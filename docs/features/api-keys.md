# API Keys & Webhooks

Integrate Bambuddy with external tools using API keys and webhooks.

!!! tip "New in v0.2.4 — Cloud access for API keys ([#1182](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/1182))"
    API keys now carry an **owner** (the user who created them) and an opt-in
    **cloud-access scope**. Tick *Allow cloud access* on a new key to let it
    read its owner's Bambu Cloud presets, filament catalogue, and device list
    via `/api/v1/cloud/*` — perfect for headless slicing pipelines. Default
    is **off**, so existing automation never silently gains cloud-read
    access on upgrade. Jump to [Cloud Access Scope](#cloud-access-scope)
    below for the details.

## :material-key: API Keys

### Overview

API keys allow external applications to:

- Access Bambuddy data
- Trigger actions
- Integrate with automation tools

### Creating an API Key

1. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Home Assistant")
4. Select permissions
5. Click **Create**
6. **Copy the key immediately** - it won't be shown again!

!!! warning "Save Your Key"
    API keys are shown only once at creation. Store it securely.

## :material-shield-lock: Permissions

### Available Permissions

API keys are intentionally **scoped narrowly** — they cannot perform
administrative operations (user management, full settings updates, backup
restore, firmware installs). The seven toggles you can set on a key are:

| Permission | Allows |
|------------|--------|
| **Read Status** | Read printer state, archives, queue, library listings, projects, filaments, inventory, maintenance, notifications, K-profiles, AMS history, stats, system info, camera, and (scrubbed) settings |
| **Manage Queue** | Add to / remove from / reorder the print queue; reprint archives |
| **Control Printer** | Start, pause, resume, stop prints; send files to the printer; AMS RFID re-read; clear-plate confirmation; smart-plug on/off |
| **Manage Library** | Upload new files; rename and delete your own library entries; import models from MakerWorld |
| **Manage Inventory** | Create / update / delete spools, the spool/color catalogue, forecast SKU settings. Required for SpoolBuddy kiosks (NFC tag scan, scale readings, kiosk system commands like reboot/update). |
| **Allow Cloud Access** | Read the owner's Bambu Cloud presets/filaments via `/cloud/*` (see below) |
| **Update Electricity Price** | Push a new per-kWh tariff to `POST /settings/electricity-price` (see [Energy Tracking](energy.md#dynamic-electricity-price-from-home-assistant)) — narrowly scoped, the only settings field writable via API key |

!!! warning "Allowlist model since 0.2.4.5 (GHSA-r2qv-8222-hqg3)"
    Earlier Bambuddy versions gated API keys via a small denylist of
    administrative permissions. Anything outside that list — including
    physical printer control, queue writes, library uploads, and inventory
    writes — was reachable from *any* valid key regardless of which
    checkboxes you ticked, because the seven toggles were not actually
    enforced outside the legacy `/webhook/*` endpoints. Starting in
    0.2.4.5, every Bambuddy endpoint maps to exactly one of the toggles
    above (or is admin-only and rejects all API keys). A key with no
    toggles ticked can hit no endpoints; a key with only **Read Status**
    cannot stop a print, edit the queue, upload files, or change a spool.

!!! info "Why no general 'Write Settings' or 'Admin' permission?"
    The `PATCH /settings` route can rewrite SMTP/LDAP/MQTT credentials, the
    HA access token, and similar secrets. Allowing those writes from any
    API key would silently widen attack surface beyond what the documented
    use cases (Home Assistant tariffs, dashboards, automation) actually
    need. The narrowly-scoped **Update Electricity Price** toggle exists
    specifically to unlock the HA dynamic-tariff workflow without opening
    that door.

### Principle of Least Privilege

Only grant permissions that are needed:

- **Read-only dashboards**: Read Status only.
- **Home Assistant queue automation**: Read Status + Manage Queue.
- **Home Assistant queue + start prints**: + Control Printer.
- **Headless slicer / library-uploading automation**: + Manage Library.
- **SpoolBuddy kiosks (bundled installs handle this for you)**: + Manage Inventory.
- **HA dynamic-tariff integration**: + Update Electricity Price.
- **Bambu Cloud slicing pipelines**: + Allow Cloud Access (requires owner sign-in).

### Upgrade Notes

When upgrading from a pre-0.2.4.5 install:

- Existing keys are backfilled: **Manage Library** and **Manage Inventory**
  default to whatever **Manage Queue** was set to (so "queue-only" keys keep
  working for the upload+queue workflow they already used, while hardened
  "read-only" keys do not silently gain write capabilities).
- The bundled SpoolBuddy kiosk key is explicitly granted **Manage Inventory**
  by the CLI (it needs to write NFC scans and scale readings).
- If a previously-working integration starts returning 403, the missing
  toggle is named in the response body — tick it in **Settings → API
  Keys**, regenerate or update the key, and retry.

## :material-cloud-key-outline: Cloud Access Scope

API keys created in v0.2.4 and later carry an explicit **owner** (the user who
created them) and an opt-in **cloud-access scope**. This unlocks a workflow that
was previously blocked: reading the owner's Bambu Cloud presets, filament
catalogue, and device list from `/api/v1/cloud/*` endpoints — exactly what a
headless slicing pipeline needs.

### When to enable it

Tick **Allow cloud access** on the create form when the key needs to:

- Pull filament profiles (`GET /cloud/filaments`) for an automated slicer
- List your Bambu Cloud devices (`GET /cloud/devices`)
- Read printer firmware availability (`GET /cloud/firmware-updates`)
- Read your slicer presets (`GET /cloud/settings`)

The flag defaults to **off**, so existing automation never silently gains
cloud-read access on upgrade.

### Three fences a key must pass for /cloud/*

When an API-keyed call reaches `/api/v1/cloud/*`, three checks all need to
succeed:

1. **The key has an owner.** Keys created before v0.2.4 have no owner and are
   shown as **Legacy** in the API Keys list — they're rejected at `/cloud/*`
   with a "recreate it" message. Every other endpoint they were used against
   (queue, status, control) keeps working.
2. **`Allow cloud access` is enabled** on the key. Otherwise `/cloud/*` returns
   `403` with a "enable cloud access" hint.
3. **The owner is signed into Bambu Cloud** (Settings → Cloud Profiles).
   Without a stored token, `/cloud/*` returns the standard token-not-set error.

### Auth-disabled deployments

The cloud-access scope only makes sense when authentication is enabled —
auth-disabled deployments don't have per-user cloud tokens to read against.
The create form refuses `Allow cloud access = true` in that mode with a
`400 Bad Request` so you don't end up with a non-functional key.

### Migrating older keys

Keys created before v0.2.4 keep working against every non-cloud endpoint
without any change. To grant one of them cloud access, **delete the key and
recreate it** — there's no in-place upgrade because the original creator
identity wasn't recorded at the time.

### Owner deletion

Deleting a user removes all of their API keys (`ON DELETE CASCADE` on
PostgreSQL, plus an explicit cleanup step in the user-delete route for SQLite
where FK enforcement is off by default). Orphan keys can never authenticate.

## :material-webhook: Webhooks

### Outgoing Webhooks

Bambuddy can send notifications to external URLs:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications**
2. Add a **Webhook** provider
3. Enter your endpoint URL
4. Configure events to trigger

### Payload Format

```json
{
  "event": "print_complete",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "printer": "Workshop X1C",
    "filename": "benchy.3mf",
    "duration": 8100,
    "filament_used": 45.2,
    "filament_details": "PLA: 30.0g | PETG: 15.2g",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

For failed/stopped prints, `filament_used` is scaled by progress and additional fields are included:

```json
{
  "event": "print_failed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T15:15:00Z",
  "data": {
    "printer": "Workshop X1C",
    "filename": "benchy.3mf",
    "duration": 2700,
    "filament_used": 7.6,
    "filament_details": "PLA: 7.6g",
    "progress": 50,
    "reason": "Filament runout",
    "status": "failed"
  }
}
```

### Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `print_started` | Print begins |
| `print_progress` | Progress milestone |
| `print_complete` | Print finishes (includes filament usage) |
| `print_failed` | Print fails (includes scaled filament usage and progress) |
| `print_stopped` | Manual cancellation (includes scaled filament usage and progress) |
| `printer_offline` | Connection lost |
| `printer_error` | HMS error |

## :material-home-assistant: Integration Examples

### Home Assistant

Use REST sensors to display status:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: "Bambuddy Printer Status"
    resource: "http://bambuddy:8000/api/v1/printers/1/status"
    headers:
      X-API-Key: "your-api-key"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    json_attributes:
      - progress
      - remaining_time
      - temperature
```

Trigger automations on webhook events.

### Node-RED

Use HTTP request nodes with API key authentication.

### IFTTT / Zapier

Use webhook triggers and actions.

## :material-cog: Managing API Keys

### Viewing Keys

See all API keys in Settings:

- Name
- Created date
- Last used
- Permissions

### Revoking Keys

Delete keys that are no longer needed:

1. Find the key in the list
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

Key is immediately invalidated.

### Rotating Keys

Best practice: Rotate keys periodically:

1. Create new key
2. Update applications
3. Delete old key

---

## :material-shield-check: Security Best Practices

### Key Storage

- Never commit keys to version control
- Use environment variables
- Store in secrets managers

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS for external access
- Limit API access to trusted IPs if possible
- Consider VPN for remote access

### Monitoring

- Review API key usage
- Check for unauthorized access
- Revoke unused keys

### Permissions

- Use minimum required permissions
- Create separate keys per application
- Avoid using admin keys in automation

---

## :material-help-circle: Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

- Check API key is correct
- Verify key hasn't been revoked
- Ensure header name is `X-API-Key`

### 403 Forbidden

- Check key has required permissions
- Verify endpoint matches permissions

## :material-lightbulb: Tips

!!! tip "Descriptive Names"
    Name keys after their purpose: "Home Assistant Dashboard" not "key1".

!!! tip "Separate Keys"
    Use different keys for different applications for easy management.

!!! tip "Regular Audit"
    Review API keys periodically and remove unused ones.

!!! tip "Test First"
    Test API calls manually before implementing in automation.

!!! tip "Document Usage"
    Keep notes on which keys are used where.

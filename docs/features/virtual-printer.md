## Overview

The Virtual Printer feature allows Bambuddy to emulate one or more Bambu Lab printers on your network. This enables you to send prints directly from Bambu Studio or OrcaSlicer to Bambuddy, even without a physical printer connected.

You can create **multiple virtual printers**, each with its own dedicated IP address, mode, printer model, and access code. Each virtual printer runs completely independent services (FTP, MQTT, SSDP, Bind).

When enabled, each virtual printer:

- Can be discovered automatically via SSDP (same LAN) or added manually by IP (VPN, remote, Docker bridge)
- Accepts print jobs over secure TLS connections (MQTT + FTP)
- Archives prints directly, queues them for review, or adds them to the print queue
- Works with the same workflow as sending to a real Bambu Lab printer
- Runs on its own dedicated bind IP with independent services

## Modes

The virtual printer supports four modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Immediate** | Files are archived automatically when received |
| **Review** | Files go to pending uploads for manual review before archiving |
| **Print Queue** | Files are archived AND added to the print queue (unassigned). Two toggles: **Auto-dispatch** controls whether incoming prints start automatically (enabled by default) or require manual dispatch. **Force color match** (off by default — opt-in) tells the scheduler to refuse to dispatch onto a printer that does not have the exact filament type and color loaded. Without it, the queue uses model-only matching and may pick a printer with the wrong colour loaded. |
| **Proxy** | Forwards traffic directly to a real printer (remote printing) |

The first three are **server modes** — Bambuddy runs its own FTP/MQTT servers and receives files locally. **Proxy mode** is different — Bambuddy uses transparent TCP proxying to forward traffic to a real printer, with end-to-end TLS between the slicer and printer for most protocols.

!!! tip "Server modes with a target printer mirror its live state to the slicer"
    When you set a **target printer** on an Immediate / Review / Print Queue VP, the slicer sees the target's live AMS slots, FTS / dual-extruder routing, k-profiles, nozzle / temperature state, and the camera stream — same view a direct slicer connection would get, but with Bambuddy's queue / archive / review workflow on the receiving end. AMS load / dry / calibration commands from the slicer pass through to the real printer too. See [Live target-printer mirror](#live-target-printer-mirror) for setup and the access-code requirement for camera. If you don't set a target, the VP behaves as a pure file receiver with no live data — which is fine if you only need slice-and-archive.

---

## Required Ports

!!! tip "You don't usually need to configure these"
    The installer and UI handle port setup automatically. This table is reference for advanced setups, firewall rules, or Docker networking — safe to skim on a first read.

Each virtual printer uses these ports on its dedicated bind IP:

| Service | Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------|---------|
| Bind | 3000, 3002 | TCP | Slicer bind/detect handshake (required for all modes) |
| SSDP | 2021 | UDP | Printer discovery (same LAN only, not needed for VPN/remote) |
| MQTT | 8883 | TCP/TLS | Printer communication |
| File Transfer | 6000 | TCP/TLS | Verify job & file upload tunnel (proxy mode) |
| RTSP Camera | 322 | TCP/TLS | Camera streaming for X1/H2/P2 series (proxy mode, **and non-proxy modes when a target printer is configured** — required for the slicer's live camera view to work through the VP) |
| FTPS | 990 | TCP/TLS | File transfer control |
| FTP Data | 50000-50100 | TCP | File transfer passive data |

!!! note "Dual Bind Ports"
    Different versions of BambuStudio and OrcaSlicer use different ports for the bind/detect handshake. Bambuddy listens on **both 3000 and 3002** to support all slicer versions.

!!! note "Port 990"
    The FTP server binds directly to port 990 (the standard FTPS port). This requires `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability for the process, or running as root. The systemd service file and Docker image already include this capability.

---

## Certificate Installation

!!! info "Required Step"
    The virtual printer uses TLS encryption with a self-signed CA certificate.
    On macOS and Windows, Bambu Studio and OrcaSlicer **do not use the system certificate store** — you must add the certificate directly to the slicer's `printer.cer` file.
    On Linux the right approach depends on how you installed the slicer: native `.deb` / `.rpm` packages can use the system CA store, but AppImage builds typically need the bundled `printer.cer` edited directly. See the [Linux tab](#step-2-append-the-bambuddy-ca-certificate-to-slicer) for both paths.

### Step 1: Get the CA Certificate

The easiest way is straight from the Bambuddy UI — no command line needed:

1. Go to **Settings → Virtual Printer**
2. In the **Slicer certificate** card, click **Download** to save `bambuddy-virtual-printer-ca.crt`, or **Copy** to put the PEM text on your clipboard
3. The card also shows the certificate's **SHA-256 fingerprint**, so you can verify later that the slicer has the right one

This is the shared CA that every virtual printer presents — you import it once and it covers all of them. It is generated automatically the first time you open the Virtual Printer settings, so you do **not** need to enable a virtual printer first.

!!! note "Getting it from the filesystem instead"
    If you prefer the command line, the CA certificate file is at:

    - **Native install**: `virtual_printer/certs/bbl_ca.crt`
    - **Docker**: `docker cp bambuddy:/app/data/virtual_printer/certs/bbl_ca.crt ./bambuddy-ca.crt`

### Step 2: Append the Bambuddy CA Certificate to Slicer

The slicer's `printer.cer` file contains PEM certificates. You need to **append** the Bambuddy CA certificate to this file.
    
!!! note ""
    The slicer's printer connection certificates are completely separate from the system keyring. 

Open `printer.cer` in a text editor and:

1. **Go to the end of the file**
2. **Paste the entire contents of `bambuddy-ca.crt`** after the last `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`
3. **Save the file**
4. **Fully restart the slicer** (Cmd+Q on macOS, not just close the window)

!!! tip "Keep Original Certificates"
    Appending (rather than replacing) preserves your ability to connect to physical Bambu Lab printers while also enabling the virtual printer.

**Certificate file locations:**
    
!!! warning "Certificate file location depends on installation options"
    When changing the installation path or method, the files location may differ from the defaults listed below,
    search for a file named `printer.cer` located in the `resources/cert/` subfolders.

=== "macOS"
    - **Bambu Studio:** `/Applications/BambuStudio.app/Contents/Resources/cert/printer.cer`
    - **OrcaSlicer:** `/Applications/OrcaSlicer.app/Contents/Resources/cert/printer.cer`

=== "Windows"
    - **Bambu Studio:** `C:\Program Files\Bambu Studio\resources\cert\printer.cer`
    - **OrcaSlicer:** `C:\Program Files\OrcaSlicer\resources\cert\printer.cer`

=== "Linux"
    The right approach depends on how you installed Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer.

    **AppImage — extract and edit `printer.cer`**

    The system CA store path is unreliable for AppImage builds even when
    `tls_cert_store_accepted: yes` is set in `BambuStudio.conf` ([#1140](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/1140))
    — the AppImage ships its own networking stack and doesn't always honour the
    system bundle. Extract the AppImage, edit the bundled `printer.cer`, then
    run from the extracted tree:

    ```bash
    ./Bambu_Studio_linux_*.AppImage --appimage-extract
    # edit squashfs-root/usr/share/Bambu Studio/resources/cert/printer.cer
    ./squashfs-root/AppRun
    ```

    Append the contents of `bbl_ca.crt` after the last `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`
    in `printer.cer`, save, and run `./squashfs-root/AppRun`. You need to repeat
    this each time you update the AppImage to a new version (the old extracted
    tree won't pick up new slicer features).

    **Flatpak — edit `printer.cer`**

    The system CA store path doesn't work properly in Flatpak
    due to sandboxing. The `printer.cer` location is different to the native
    and AppImage installations. Edit `printer.cer` and append the
    Virtual Printer CA. Location:

    ```bash
    # edit /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.orcaslicer.OrcaSlicer/current/active/files/share/OrcaSlicer/cert/printer.cer
    ```

    Append the contents of `bbl_ca.crt` after the last `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`
    in `printer.cer`, save, and restart your slicer. You will probably need to repeat
    this each time you update the Flatpak to a new version.

    **Native package install (`.deb` / `.rpm`) — system CA store**

    Native packages link against the system OpenSSL and pick up the system CA
    bundle when `tls_cert_store_accepted: yes` is set in
    `~/.config/BambuStudio/BambuStudio.conf` (the default after first launch).

    Debian / Ubuntu / Mint / Raspberry Pi OS:

    ```bash
    sudo cp bbl_ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/bambuddy-ca.crt   # extension MUST be .crt
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    ```

    Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE:

    ```bash
    sudo cp bbl_ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/bambuddy-ca.crt
    sudo update-ca-trust
    ```

    Arch:

    ```bash
    sudo trust anchor --store bbl_ca.crt
    ```

    Then **fully quit and relaunch** the slicer.

    !!! warning "Common pitfall"
        Dropping the `.crt` file directly into `/etc/ssl/certs/` and running
        `update-ca-certificates` is a no-op — the tool only picks up files placed
        under `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` with a `.crt` extension.

    If the system CA store doesn't work for your install (Flatpak sandboxes,
    statically-linked builds, or AppImage despite the conf setting), fall back
    to the direct-edit path:

    - **Bambu Studio (`.deb`/`.rpm`):** `/usr/share/Bambu Studio/resources/cert/printer.cer`
    - **OrcaSlicer (`.deb`/`.rpm`):** `/usr/share/OrcaSlicer/resources/cert/printer.cer`

    Editing those requires `sudo` and gets reverted on every package update.

    These are owned by root; edit with `sudo`.

!!! warning "When to Update the Certificate"
    You must update the `printer.cer` file whenever:

    - **First-time setup** — append the Bambuddy CA certificate
    - **New Bambuddy installation** — each install generates a unique CA
    - **Switching Bambuddy hosts** — each host has its own CA (unless you [share the CA](#multiple-bambuddy-hosts))
    - **After slicer updates** — updates may restore the original certificate file, requiring you to append again

### Certificate Persistence

The CA certificate is generated once and persists across Bambuddy restarts. If you switch between Docker and native installations, share the certificate directory to avoid regenerating:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./virtual_printer:/app/data/virtual_printer
```

### Multiple Bambuddy Hosts

Each Bambuddy installation generates its own unique CA certificate.

!!! warning "One Bambuddy CA at a Time"
    When switching between Bambuddy hosts with different CAs, remove the old Bambuddy CA and append the new one. Having multiple Bambuddy CAs may cause confusion about which host to connect to.

**Option 1: Share the CA (Recommended)**

Copy the `certs/` directory from one host to all others:

```bash
# Copy certs from host1 to host2
scp -r host1:/path/to/virtual_printer/certs/ host2:/path/to/virtual_printer/
```

Then restart Bambuddy on host2. All hosts will use the same CA, so one certificate in the slicer works for all.

**Option 2: Update Certificate When Switching Hosts**

Each time you switch to a different Bambuddy host:

1. Extract the CA from the new host
2. Open the slicer's `printer.cer` file
3. Remove the old Bambuddy CA (if present) and append the new one
4. Fully restart the slicer

## :material-shield-lock: Tailscale Integration (Optional)

!!! info "Host-level Tailscale, surfaced on the VP card"
    Tailscale integration is **opt-in per VP** (default: off). When you flip the
    **Tailscale integration** toggle on a virtual printer card, Bambuddy reads the
    **host's** Tailscale identity from the local tailscaled daemon and shows the
    host's `100.x.x.x` IP and MagicDNS hostname inline on that card — so you know
    which address to paste into your slicer when it's running on a different network
    than Bambuddy. The Tailscale identity is **host-level**: every VP on the same
    Bambuddy install shares the same IP and FQDN. The per-VP toggle controls whether
    the address is displayed on that card, nothing more.

### What this gives you

**Secure remote slicer access**: when your slicer machine and the Bambuddy host are
on the same tailnet, the slicer reaches Bambuddy over a private, end-to-end
WireGuard-encrypted tunnel — without port forwarding, DDNS, reverse proxies, or
exposing anything to the public internet. The slicer connects to Bambuddy's
`100.x.x.x` exactly like it would a real printer on the LAN.

!!! warning "Slicer-side caveat — CA import is still required"
    Two independent reasons make Tailscale's automatic-HTTPS feature unusable for the
    slicer → printer connection:

    1. Both **Bambu Studio** and **OrcaSlicer** validate printer TLS only against their
       bundled BBL CA store, not the system trust store. Even a valid Let's Encrypt
       cert would be rejected.
    2. Both slicers' **Add Printer** dialog only accepts an **IP address** — not a
       hostname. A Let's Encrypt cert is bound to a hostname (`your-host.<tailnet>.ts.net`);
       the slicer would compare it against the `100.x.x.x` IP it actually connected to
       and fail the hostname check, even if its trust store accepted the issuer.

    **You still need to [import Bambuddy's self-signed CA](#certificate-installation)
    into your slicer**, same as a LAN-mode install. Tailscale's role is **secure
    network reach** — not cert-import elimination.

### How it works

When at least one VP has the toggle enabled, Bambuddy invokes `tailscale status --json`
on the host, parses `Self.DNSName` and `Self.TailscaleIPs`, and renders the result on
the VP card as `100.x.x.x (your-host.<tailnet>.ts.net)` with a copy button. The status
is cached for 60 seconds.

Bambuddy itself does **not** join your tailnet — there is no Bambuddy-side sidecar
and no auth-key field in Bambuddy settings. The host running tailscaled is the
device in your tailnet; Bambuddy is just a process on that host reporting the
host's IP to the UI.

If you run multiple VPs on one Bambuddy install, they share the same host-level
Tailscale IP. Your slicer disambiguates them the same way it does on the LAN: by
the per-VP serial number written into each VP's SSDP record, plus a matching
slicer-side printer profile per VP.

### Setup — install Tailscale on the Bambuddy host

Bambuddy does not run Tailscale itself; it just *reads* `tailscale status` from the
host's tailscaled daemon. Setup is whatever Tailscale's normal install flow looks
like for your platform.

If you already have Tailscale running on the Bambuddy host and `tailscale status`
works, skip to **Setup — per VP** below. Otherwise pick your platform and follow
the install steps.

=== "Linux (Debian / Ubuntu / Mint / Raspberry Pi OS)"

    The official Tailscale install script auto-detects your distro and adds the
    upstream apt repository. Run it as root:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Then bring the daemon up and authenticate. The command prints a one-time
    login URL — open it in any browser to attach this host to your tailnet:

    ```bash
    sudo tailscale up
    ```

    Verify Bambuddy will see it:

    ```bash
    tailscale status        # should print at least your own 100.x.x.x line
    ```

    Bambuddy picks up the host's identity automatically the next time you flip
    a VP's Tailscale toggle on.

=== "Linux (Fedora / RHEL / CentOS)"

    Same install script — it auto-detects RPM-based distros and adds the dnf repo:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
    sudo tailscale up
    tailscale status
    ```

    On selinux-strict systems (RHEL 9 / Rocky / Alma) you may need to
    `sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1` if Bambuddy runs under a
    confined service unit; the default Bambuddy systemd unit is unconfined and
    doesn't need this.

=== "macOS"

    Tailscale ships as a Mac App Store app **and** a standalone CLI. Bambuddy
    needs the CLI to be reachable from the user running Bambuddy.

    **Easiest path — Homebrew (CLI + daemon, no App Store account needed):**

    ```bash
    brew install tailscale
    sudo brew services start tailscale
    sudo tailscale up
    tailscale status
    ```

    **App Store path:** install
    [Tailscale from the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/tailscale/id1475387142),
    sign in, then open a terminal and run:

    ```bash
    /Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale status
    ```

    If that works but plain `tailscale` doesn't, symlink the CLI somewhere in
    `$PATH` (so the user running Bambuddy can find it):

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale /usr/local/bin/tailscale
    ```

=== "Windows"

    1. Download the MSI installer from
       [tailscale.com/download/windows](https://tailscale.com/download/windows)
       and run it.
    2. Sign in via the system-tray icon; the host attaches to your tailnet.
    3. Open PowerShell as the same user Bambuddy runs under and verify:

       ```powershell
       tailscale status
       ```

    The Tailscale MSI adds `tailscale.exe` to `PATH` for new shells; if
    Bambuddy was already running, restart it so it inherits the updated `PATH`.

=== "Docker (Bambuddy in container, Tailscale on host)"

    This is the **recommended** Docker path — install Tailscale on the host as
    one of the platforms above, then mount the host's tailscaled socket into the
    Bambuddy container so the container's `tailscale` CLI can talk to it.

    In `docker-compose.yml`:

    ```yaml
    services:
      bambuddy:
        # ...
        volumes:
          - /var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock:/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock
    ```

    Tailscale itself runs **on the host**, not inside the Bambuddy container.
    Bambuddy logs a one-time hint at startup if it detects it's running inside
    Docker without this socket mounted.

    Run `tailscale status` from inside the container to confirm the socket mount
    works:

    ```bash
    docker exec bambuddy tailscale status
    ```

=== "Synology / TrueNAS / Unraid"

    These NAS platforms ship Tailscale as a first-party package or community
    plugin — install it through the NAS UI rather than via the install script,
    so updates flow through the platform's package manager. After install, sign
    in and verify with `tailscale status` from the NAS shell. Then mount
    `/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock` into the Bambuddy container exactly as
    in the Docker tab above.

    | Platform | Where to install Tailscale from |
    |---|---|
    | Synology DSM 7+ | [Package Center → Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1131/synology) (official) |
    | TrueNAS SCALE | Apps catalog → community "tailscale" app |
    | Unraid | Community Applications → "Tailscale" |

!!! tip "Authenticating without a browser on the host"
    On headless machines (Raspberry Pi, NAS, remote server) `sudo tailscale up`
    still prints a login URL — copy it to a browser on any other device on
    your network and sign in there. The host doesn't need a local browser.

!!! tip "Generate a reusable auth key"
    For unattended setups, generate an
    [auth key](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) in the Tailscale
    admin console and run `sudo tailscale up --authkey=tskey-...` instead — no
    interactive login required.

### Setup — install Tailscale on the slicer machine

Tailscale is a tunnel, not a tunnel-server — **both ends** need to be on the
tailnet. Install Tailscale on whichever machine runs Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer
and sign it in to the **same Tailscale account** (or accept an invite to the
host's tailnet, if you split accounts).

=== "Windows (most slicer users)"

    1. Download the MSI from
       [tailscale.com/download/windows](https://tailscale.com/download/windows)
       and run it.
    2. Sign in via the system-tray icon — use the same Tailscale account as the
       Bambuddy host, or accept the host's tailnet invite.
    3. Open PowerShell and verify reachability to your Bambuddy host. Replace
       `100.x.x.x` with the IP shown on the Bambuddy VP card:

       ```powershell
       tailscale status
       ping 100.x.x.x
       ```

       A successful ping confirms the tunnel is up.

=== "macOS"

    Install from the
    [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/tailscale/id1475387142)
    (recommended for desktop use — the menu-bar app handles sign-in and
    auto-reconnect), then sign in to the same tailnet as the Bambuddy host.

    Verify from Terminal:

    ```bash
    tailscale status
    ping 100.x.x.x
    ```

=== "Linux desktop"

    Use the same install script as the host:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
    sudo tailscale up        # sign in to the same tailnet as the Bambuddy host
    ping 100.x.x.x
    ```

=== "Phone / tablet (read-only access)"

    Tailscale's
    [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/tailscale/id1470499037) and
    [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tailscale.ipn)
    apps both connect the device to your tailnet for browser access to the
    Bambuddy UI (`http://100.x.x.x:8000` or
    `http://your-host.<tailnet>.ts.net:8000`). The mobile apps are read-only as
    far as the Bambu slicer is concerned — there is no Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer
    for mobile — but they're useful for monitoring prints away from home.

!!! tip "Same account, or shared node?"
    The simplest setup is to sign in to the **same Tailscale account** on both
    the Bambuddy host and the slicer machine — everything works automatically.
    If you'd rather keep them on separate accounts (e.g. work laptop), the
    Bambuddy admin can [share the Bambuddy node](https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing)
    from their tailnet to your account — same effect, separate billing.

### Verify the connection works

Before you touch the slicer, confirm end-to-end reachability from the slicer
machine. Open a terminal / PowerShell on the **slicer machine** and run:

```bash
tailscale ping 100.x.x.x         # ICMP via tailnet
curl -k https://100.x.x.x:8000/  # Bambuddy web UI
```

- `tailscale ping` should show `pong` within a few ms once the direct path
  is established (it may briefly show `via DERP` first while NAT traversal
  negotiates — that's normal and still works).
- `curl -k` should return the Bambuddy login page HTML. The `-k` is needed
  only until you import Bambuddy's CA into the slicer machine (see
  [certificate installation](#certificate-installation)).

If both succeed, your slicer is ready to talk to Bambuddy over Tailscale.

### Setup — per VP

1. On the VP card, flip **Tailscale integration** on.
2. Within a few seconds, the card shows `100.x.x.x (your-host.<tailnet>.ts.net)`
   with a copy button.
3. Paste that `100.x.x.x` (or the MagicDNS hostname) into your slicer's
   **Add Printer** dialog.
4. (One-time) [import Bambuddy's CA](#certificate-installation) into the slicer if
   you haven't already.

### When Tailscale is the right choice

| You want… | Tailscale helps? |
|---|---|
| Print to Bambuddy from your laptop on another network | **Yes** — private tunnel, no port forwarding |
| Print from a friend's house or public wifi | **Yes** — tailnet reach is location-independent |
| Avoid exposing Bambuddy on the public internet | **Yes** — tailnet is private (CGNAT) |
| Eliminate the one-time CA import in Bambu Studio / Orca | **No** — slicer trusts only its bundled BBL CA |
| A separate Tailscale identity per VP | *Not today* — see roadmap below |

### Roadmap — per-VP Tailscale identities

A future release may register each VP as its own node in your tailnet (each with its
own `100.x.x.x` and `bambuddy-<vp>.<tailnet>.ts.net` MagicDNS hostname) so multiple
VPs are individually discoverable. That work is being scoped — track
[#701](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/701) and related issues.

### <a name="tailscale-troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

#### Toggle is on but no Tailscale address shows on the card

Bambuddy couldn't reach tailscaled. Usual causes:

- **Native install**: `tailscale` is not in `$PATH` of the user running the Bambuddy
  service, or `tailscaled` is not running. Verify with `tailscale status` from the
  same shell environment Bambuddy runs under.
- **Docker**: the host's `/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock` isn't mounted into the
  container. Bambuddy logs a one-time hint when it detects this — check the container
  log for the message starting *"Running in Docker but …"*.
- **Not logged in**: tailscaled is running but the host is not authenticated
  (`tailscale up` was never run, or the device was logged out). The status query
  returns an empty `DNSName` and Bambuddy treats Tailscale as unavailable.

#### Slicer still shows "untrusted cert" / "failed to connect"

Expected if you skipped the CA import. Both Bambu Studio and OrcaSlicer trust only
their bundled BBL CA store for printer-MQTT connections — system-trusted certs are
rejected regardless of how the slicer reaches the host. Import Bambuddy's CA into
the slicer [as described above](#certificate-installation), then connect to the
host's Tailscale IP.

#### FQDN copy button shows "Failed to copy"

`navigator.clipboard` is only available in secure contexts (HTTPS or `localhost`).
On plain HTTP Bambuddy falls back to a legacy `document.execCommand('copy')` path.
If both fail (very old browser, hostile extension), select the hostname manually
and copy with Ctrl/Cmd-C.

## Platform Setup

Choose your platform below for specific setup instructions.

### Linux (Native Installation)

Port 990 is a privileged port. The process needs `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` to bind to it.

**For systemd services**, add to the service file:
```ini
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

**For manual runs**, grant the capability to the Python binary:
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep $(readlink -f $(which python3))
    ```

**Firewall rules (if using UFW):**

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp  # Bind/detect
sudo ufw allow 3002/tcp  # Bind/detect
sudo ufw allow 2021/udp  # SSDP
sudo ufw allow 8883/tcp  # MQTT
sudo ufw allow 990/tcp   # FTPS
sudo ufw allow 6000/tcp  # File transfer tunnel
sudo ufw allow 322/tcp   # RTSP camera (X1/H2/P2)
sudo ufw allow 2024:2026/tcp  # Proprietary slicer ports (A1/P1S)
sudo ufw allow 50000:50100/tcp  # FTP passive data
```

**Firewall rules (if using firewalld):**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3000/tcp  # Bind/detect
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3002/tcp  # Bind/detect
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2021/udp  # SSDP
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8883/tcp  # MQTT
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=990/tcp   # FTPS
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6000/tcp  # File transfer tunnel
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=322/tcp   # RTSP camera (X1/H2/P2)

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=50000-50100/tcp  # FTP passive data
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### Docker (Linux)

Docker requires host networking for SSDP discovery to work.

**docker-compose.yml:**

```yaml
services:
  bambuddy:
    image: ghcr.io/maziggy/bambuddy:latest
    container_name: bambuddy
    network_mode: host  # Required for SSDP discovery
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE  # Required for virtual printer proxy (port 990)
    volumes:
      - bambuddy_data:/app/data
      - bambuddy_logs:/app/logs
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  bambuddy_data:
  bambuddy_logs:
```

!!! note "No iptables redirect needed"
    The FTP server binds directly to port 990 inside the container. With `network_mode: host`, no port mapping or iptables redirect is required.

**Firewall rules (if using UFW):**

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp  # Bind/detect
sudo ufw allow 3002/tcp  # Bind/detect
sudo ufw allow 2021/udp  # SSDP
sudo ufw allow 8883/tcp  # MQTT
sudo ufw allow 990/tcp   # FTPS
sudo ufw allow 6000/tcp  # File transfer tunnel
sudo ufw allow 322/tcp   # RTSP camera (X1/H2/P2)
sudo ufw allow 2024:2026/tcp  # Proprietary slicer ports (A1/P1S)
sudo ufw allow 50000:50100/tcp  # FTP passive data
```

**Firewall rules (if using firewalld):**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3000/tcp  # Bind/detect

sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Docker (macOS / Windows)

!!! warning "Limited Support"
    Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows doesn't support host network mode.
    SSDP discovery **will not work** — you must add the printer manually by IP.

Use bridge networking with port mapping:

```yaml
services:
  bambuddy:
    image: ghcr.io/maziggy/bambuddy:latest
    container_name: bambuddy
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-8000}:8000"           # Web UI

      - "50000-50100:50000-50100"      # FTP passive data
    volumes:
      - bambuddy_data:/app/data
      - bambuddy_logs:/app/logs
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
      # Required for FTP passive mode behind Docker NAT:
      # Set to your Docker host's LAN IP
      #- VIRTUAL_PRINTER_PASV_ADDRESS=192.168.1.100
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  bambuddy_data:
  bambuddy_logs:
```

!!! tip "PASV Address"
    When using bridge mode, FTP passive data connections need to know the host's real IP. Set `VIRTUAL_PRINTER_PASV_ADDRESS` to your Docker host's LAN IP address.

---

### Unraid

1. Set **Network Type** to `host` in container settings
2. No additional configuration needed — the FTP server binds directly to port 990

---

### Synology NAS

1. Use **Host Network** in Container Manager
2. No additional configuration needed — the FTP server binds directly to port 990

---

### TrueNAS SCALE

1. Use **Host Network** when creating the app/container
2. No additional configuration needed — the FTP server binds directly to port 990

---

### Proxmox LXC

1. No special configuration needed — the FTP server binds directly to port 990
2. Ensure the LXC container runs Bambuddy as root or with `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`

---

## Configuration

### Creating a Virtual Printer

1. Complete the platform setup above first
2. Go to **Settings** in Bambuddy
3. Scroll to the **Virtual Printer** section
4. Click **Add Virtual Printer**
5. Set a **Name** for this virtual printer
6. Choose your **Mode**: Immediate, Review, Print Queue, or Proxy
7. Choose the **Printer Model** to emulate
8. Set an **Access Code** (exactly 8 characters) — not needed for Proxy mode
9. Enter a **Bind IP** — a dedicated IP address for this virtual printer
10. Click **Create**, then toggle it to **Enabled**

You can create multiple virtual printers, each with its own mode, model, and bind IP. They appear as separate printers in your slicer.

### Dedicated Bind IP

Each virtual printer requires its own dedicated IP address. This IP is used for all services (FTP, MQTT, SSDP, Bind) and must be unique across all enabled virtual printers.

For example, if you want to run 3 virtual printers:

| | IP |
|---|---|
| Bambuddy web UI | `192.168.1.100` (your main IP) |
| Virtual Printer 1 | `192.168.1.101` |
| Virtual Printer 2 | `192.168.1.102` |
| Virtual Printer 3 | `192.168.1.103` |

You add these extra IPs as **interface aliases** (secondary addresses) on your network adapter. The commands below are temporary — see the persistence section for each platform to keep them across reboots.

#### Adding Interface Aliases

!!! warning "Choose Unused IPs"
    Pick IP addresses that are **outside your DHCP range** or reserve them in your router to avoid conflicts. Check with `ping 192.168.1.101` before adding.

=== "Linux (Native / Docker Host Mode)"

    !!! note "Required package"
        The `ip` command comes from the `iproute2` package, which is pre-installed on most distros. If missing: `sudo apt install iproute2` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo dnf install iproute` (Fedora/RHEL).

    Find your interface name first:

    ```bash
    ip -br addr show
    # Example output: eth0  UP  192.168.1.100/24
    ```

    Add secondary IPs:

    ```bash
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.101/24 dev eth0
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.102/24 dev eth0
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.103/24 dev eth0
    ```

    Verify:

    ```bash
    ip addr show eth0
    # Should show inet 192.168.1.100/24, 192.168.1.101/24, etc.
    ```

    **Make persistent (choose your distro):**

    === "Netplan (Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 12+)"

        Install netplan if not already present:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install netplan.io
        ```

        Find your existing netplan config:

        ```bash
        ls /etc/netplan/
        # Usually 01-netcfg.yaml, 01-network-manager-all.yaml, or 50-cloud-init.yaml
        ```

        Edit the file (e.g., `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`) and add the `addresses` block:

        ```yaml
        network:
          version: 2
          ethernets:
            eth0:
              dhcp4: true
              addresses:
                - 192.168.1.101/24
                - 192.168.1.102/24
                - 192.168.1.103/24
        ```

        Apply:

        ```bash
        sudo netplan apply
        ```

    === "/etc/network/interfaces (Debian, Raspberry Pi OS)"

        Install `ifupdown` if not already present:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install ifupdown
        ```

        Add to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

        ```
        auto eth0:1
        iface eth0:1 inet static
            address 192.168.1.101
            netmask 255.255.255.0

        auto eth0:2
        iface eth0:2 inet static
            address 192.168.1.102
            netmask 255.255.255.0

        auto eth0:3
        iface eth0:3 inet static
            address 192.168.1.103
            netmask 255.255.255.0
        ```

        Apply without reboot:

        ```bash
        sudo ifup eth0:1
        sudo ifup eth0:2
        sudo ifup eth0:3
        ```

    === "NetworkManager (Fedora, RHEL, Arch)"

        NetworkManager and `nmcli` are pre-installed on Fedora, RHEL, and most Arch desktop installs. If missing:

        === "Fedora/RHEL"
            ```bash
            sudo dnf install NetworkManager
            ```

        === "Arch"
            ```bash
            sudo pacman -S networkmanager
            sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager
            ```

        Add secondary IPs to your connection:

        ```bash
        sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" +ipv4.addresses "192.168.1.101/24"
        sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" +ipv4.addresses "192.168.1.102/24"
        sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" +ipv4.addresses "192.168.1.103/24"

        # Apply (brief reconnect)
        sudo nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"
        ```

        !!! tip "Find your connection name"
            Run `nmcli con show` to see your connection names. Common names: `"Wired connection 1"`, `"eno1"`, `"enp0s3"`.

=== "Unraid"

    SSH into your Unraid server or use the terminal in the web UI:

    ```bash
    ip addr add 192.168.1.101/24 dev eth0
    ip addr add 192.168.1.102/24 dev eth0
    ```

    **Make persistent** — add to `/boot/config/go`:

    ```bash
    echo "ip addr add 192.168.1.101/24 dev eth0" >> /boot/config/go
    echo "ip addr add 192.168.1.102/24 dev eth0" >> /boot/config/go
    ```

=== "Synology NAS"

    SSH into your NAS:

    ```bash
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.101/24 dev eth0
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.102/24 dev eth0
    ```

    **Make persistent** — create a triggered task:

    1. Control Panel → Task Scheduler → Create → Triggered Task → User-defined script
    2. Event: **Boot-up**
    3. User: **root**
    4. Script:
    ```bash
    ip addr add 192.168.1.101/24 dev eth0
    ip addr add 192.168.1.102/24 dev eth0
    ```

=== "TrueNAS SCALE"

    You can add aliases through the web UI:

    1. Network → Interfaces → Edit your interface
    2. Add **Aliases**: `192.168.1.101/24`, `192.168.1.102/24`, etc.
    3. Click **Save** and **Apply**

    These persist automatically.

=== "Proxmox LXC"

    **Option A — Inside the LXC container (recommended):**

    Use the Linux instructions above. Install `iproute2` if missing:

    ```bash
    apt install iproute2
    ```

    Then add IPs and make persistent with netplan or `/etc/network/interfaces`.

    **Option B — From the Proxmox host:**

    Add additional network devices to the LXC config (`/etc/pve/lxc/100.conf`):

    ```
    net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,ip=192.168.1.100/24,gw=192.168.1.1
    net1: name=eth1,bridge=vmbr0,ip=192.168.1.101/24
    net2: name=eth2,bridge=vmbr0,ip=192.168.1.102/24
    ```

    Or via CLI:

    ```bash
    pct set 100 -net1 name=eth1,bridge=vmbr0,ip=192.168.1.101/24
    pct set 100 -net2 name=eth2,bridge=vmbr0,ip=192.168.1.102/24
    ```

    Restart the container after adding network devices.

=== "Docker (macOS / Windows)"

    !!! warning "Single Virtual Printer Only"
        Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows uses a VM — you cannot add host interface aliases into the container. Bridge mode limits you to **one virtual printer** per Docker host.

        For multiple virtual printers, use Linux (native or VM with host networking).

!!! tip "Docker Host Mode"
    If you're running Bambuddy in Docker with `network_mode: host`, add the aliases on the **Docker host** (not inside the container). The container inherits all host IPs automatically.

### Printer Model Selection

Choose which Bambu printer model the virtual printer should emulate:

| SSDP Code | Printer | Serial Prefix |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| 3DPrinter-X1-Carbon | X1C (default) | 00M |
| 3DPrinter-X1 | X1 | 00M |
| C13 | X1E | 03W |
| C11 | P1P | 01S |
| C12 | P1S | 01P |
| N7 | P2S | 22E |
| N2S | A1 | 039 |
| N1 | A1 Mini | 030 |
| O1D | H2D | 094 |
| O1C | H2C | 094 |
| O1S | H2S | 094 |

!!! note "Model Change"
    Changing the printer model will automatically restart the virtual printer. You may need to re-add the printer in your slicer since the serial number changes.

### Network Interface Override

!!! tip "Multi-NIC / Docker / VPN Users"
    If Bambuddy has multiple network interfaces (e.g., LAN + Tailscale, Docker with multiple bridges), the auto-detected IP may be wrong. Use **Network Interface Override** in Virtual Printer settings to select the correct interface.

    This applies to **all modes** and affects:

    - The IP address advertised via SSDP discovery
    - The IP included in the TLS certificate (SAN)

---

## Adding to Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer

!!! info "When Does Automatic Discovery Work?"
    SSDP discovery only works when the slicer and Bambuddy are on the **same network
    segment** (same LAN/subnet). You must add the printer manually by IP when:

    - Connecting over a **VPN** (WireGuard, Tailscale, etc.)
    - Using **Docker bridge mode** (macOS/Windows)
    - Connecting over the **internet** via port forwarding
    - The slicer is on a **different subnet** than Bambuddy

### Automatic Discovery

1. Ensure the virtual printer is enabled and running
2. In Bambu Studio/OrcaSlicer, go to **Device** tab
3. Click **Refresh** or wait for discovery
4. The virtual printer "Bambuddy" should appear
5. Click to add it, entering the access code when prompted

### Manual Addition (Bind with Access Code)

If automatic discovery doesn't work (VPN, remote, bridge mode):

1. In Bambu Studio, go to **Device** → **Add Printer**
2. Select **Add printer by IP** (or **Bind with access code**)
3. Enter the IP address of your Bambuddy server
4. Enter the access code (8 characters)
5. The printer will be added to your device list

!!! note "Bind/Detect Ports Required"
    The "bind with access code" handshake uses port 3000 or 3002 (depending on your slicer version). Bambuddy listens on both. Make sure these ports are reachable from the slicer (firewall, port forwarding, Docker port mapping).

---

## Sending Prints to Bambuddy

### Server Modes (Immediate / Review / Print Queue)

!!! warning "Use Send, Not Print"
    You must use the **Send** button, not the **Print** button!

    - **Send** → Transfers the file to Bambuddy (correct)
    - **Print** → Attempts to start printing immediately (won't work — there's no real printer)

1. Slice your model as usual
2. Select "Bambuddy" from the printer dropdown
3. Click the **Send** button (next to the Print button)
4. The file will be transferred to Bambuddy

![Send Button](../assets/slicer-send-button.png){ .screenshot }

**What Happens Next:**

- **Immediate**: The file is automatically archived
- **Review**: The file appears in **Pending Uploads** for you to review, assign to a project, add notes, or queue for printing
- **Print Queue**: The file is archived and added to the print queue as an unassigned job

!!! tip "Send Button Location"
    In Bambu Studio/OrcaSlicer, the Send button is typically a small icon next to the large Print button, or accessible via the dropdown arrow on the Print button.

#### Print Queue mode: Force color match

When **Print Queue** mode is selected, two toggles appear on the VP card:

- **Auto-dispatch** (on by default) — controls whether the queued job starts automatically or sits as `manual_start` until you click Start.
- **Force color match** (off by default — opt-in) — when on, Bambuddy parses the per-slot filament requirements out of the sliced 3MF at upload time and pins them onto the queue item. The scheduler then refuses to dispatch onto a printer that does not have the exact filament **type and colour** loaded.

**Why this is opt-in.** Without `Force color match`, the scheduler still validates filament **type** when the job is "Any [model]" assigned (so a PLA job won't auto-dispatch onto a printer with only PETG loaded), but it does **not** check colour — the first available printer of the target model wins. This matches Bambuddy's behaviour before the toggle existed; turning it on is strict enough that it can leave a job sitting in the queue if no printer has the right colour loaded, which is sometimes what you want and sometimes not.

**When to turn it on.** If you have multiple printers of the same model and care about colour accuracy — e.g. you don't want a job sliced for matte white PLA running on a printer that has black PLA loaded just because it happens to be free first.

**When to leave it off.** If your fleet runs the same colour on every printer of a given model, or you reload colour by hand and want the queue to keep moving regardless.

Per-VP setting (so different virtual printers can have different policies if you have a "best-fit" VP and a "first-available" VP). The default for new and existing virtual printers is **off** — no behaviour change for upgraders.

#### <a name="live-target-printer-mirror"></a>Live target-printer mirror in non-proxy modes

If you set a **target printer** on an Immediate / Review / Print Queue VP, the slicer sees the target printer's live state through the VP — AMS slots, FTS / dual-extruder routing, k-profiles, nozzle / bed / chamber temperatures, lights, and camera. AMS load / dry / calibration commands the user issues from the slicer pass through to the real printer. The slicer behaves as if it were directly connected to the real printer for *reads* and *device management*, while file uploads still terminate at Bambuddy and feed the queue / archive / review workflow. **No second MQTT session is opened on the printer** — the bridge fans out from Bambuddy's existing per-printer subscription, so the firmware in-flight budget is not affected.

This is what makes it possible to slice an FTS / dual-extruder file with the VP selected as the active device — Studio reads the target printer's nozzle diameters, AMS contents, and FTS ID through the VP and bakes the right values into the `.3mf`. The earlier guidance "don't slice with the VP active" no longer applies when the VP has a target printer set.

**Setup:** in Settings → Virtual Printer, set the target printer for each Immediate / Review / Print Queue VP. The bridge starts automatically.

**Access-code requirement for camera.** The slicer authenticates the camera RTSPS stream with whatever access code is stored in its profile for the device it bound to. For the camera to authenticate against the real printer, **the VP's access code must match the target printer's LAN access code**. Set them equal in Settings → Virtual Printer, then re-add the VP in the slicer so it picks up the new code. MQTT and FTP work either way; only the camera path needs the match because RTSPS auth happens between the slicer and the real printer's broker.

**If you don't want a live mirror.** Leave the target printer unset, or use the VP without binding it to a real printer at all. The slicer will see synthetic stub state and you set filaments manually — the original "file receiver" behaviour, useful when you want to slice for a class of printer without picking a specific one yet.

If you want the slicer to be in continuous live contact with a real printer — including for slicing-time hardware fields — use **Proxy Mode**, not a server-mode VP.

### Proxy Mode

In Proxy mode, you use the slicer normally — slice, select the printer, and click **Print** or **Send** just like you would with a local printer. Bambuddy relays everything to the real printer transparently.

    Proxy Mode enables **remote printing from anywhere in the world** through a secure TLS relay.

![Proxy Mode Architecture](../assets/proxy-mode-diagram.png){ .screenshot }

### What is Proxy Mode?

Unlike the server modes that archive files locally, **Proxy Mode** forwards your print jobs directly to a real Bambu Lab printer. Bambuddy acts as a secure relay between your slicer and your printer.

### How It Works

1. **Select the target printer** in Bambuddy settings (must be in LAN mode)
2. **For cross-network:** select the slicer network interface for SSDP relay
3. **Enable the proxy** — printer appears in slicer discovery via SSDP
4. **Connect** using the printer's access code
5. **Print as normal** — traffic is relayed through Bambuddy

### Proxy Mode Ports

| Protocol | Bambuddy Listen Port | Printer Port | Purpose |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| Bind | 3000, 3002 | — (local) | Slicer bind/detect handshake (served locally) |
| MQTT/TLS | 8883 | 8883 | Printer control & status (TLS-terminated, IP rewriting) |
| File Transfer | 6000 | 6000 | File transfer tunnel (transparent proxy, end-to-end TLS) |
| RTSP Camera | 322 | 322 | Camera streaming (transparent proxy, end-to-end TLS) |
| FTP/FTPS | 990 | 990 | FTP control (transparent proxy, end-to-end TLS) |
| FTP Data | 50000-50100 | dynamic | FTP passive data (transparent proxy) |
| Proprietary | 2024-2026 | 2024-2026 | Slicer–printer communication (A1/P1S, transparent proxy) |

!!! warning "FTP Data Channel Security"
    Bambu Studio's FTP implementation does not encrypt the data channel — even though
    it negotiates PROT P (encrypted), it sends file data in cleartext. The MQTT control
    channel (commands, status) **is** fully TLS-encrypted.

    **What this means:** Your 3MF print files are transferred unencrypted between the
    slicer and Bambuddy. Between Bambuddy and your printer, the data channel encryption
    depends on the printer model (some use PROT P, some use PROT C).

    **Recommendation:** When using Proxy Mode over the internet, place a VPN
    (WireGuard, Tailscale, or similar) between your slicer and Bambuddy to protect
    the FTP data channel.

### Requirements

**Printer Requirements:**

- Bambu Lab printer in **LAN Mode** (Developer Mode)
- Printer must be accessible from Bambuddy on your local network
- Printer's IP address and access code

**Network Requirements:**

- Bambuddy server accessible from the slicer (same LAN, VPN, or internet)
- Ports **3000 + 3002** (bind), **990** (FTP), **6000** (file transfer), **8883** (MQTT), **322** (RTSP camera), **2024-2026** (A1/P1S proprietary), and **50000-50100** (FTP data) reachable from the slicer
- Static IP or dynamic DNS for your Bambuddy server (if remote)

**Supported Network Configurations:**

| Setup | SSDP Discovery | Manual Add | Notes |
|-------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Same LAN | Automatic | Yes | SSDP broadcast reaches slicer directly |
| Dual-homed (2 NICs) | Automatic | Yes | Use Network Interface Override to select correct NIC |
| Docker host mode (Linux) | Automatic | Yes | Host networking passes SSDP traffic |
| Different VLANs (routed) | Automatic | Yes | SSDP cross-subnet listener responds to M-SEARCH from any interface |
| Docker bridge mode | **Not available** | **Required** | Bridge networking blocks UDP multicast |
| VPN (tun mode) | **Not available** | **Required** | Tun VPN tunnels don't carry UDP broadcast; use manual add |
| VPN (tap mode) | Automatic | Yes | Tap mode bridges L2 traffic including broadcasts |
| Port forwarding / internet | **Not available** | **Required** | SSDP is local-network only |

### Setting Up Proxy Mode

#### Step 1: Complete Platform Setup

Make sure you've completed the [Platform Setup](#platform-setup) for your installation (iptables rules, firewall ports, Docker config).

#### Step 2: Configure Remote Access (if needed)

To access from outside your home network, forward these ports on your router:

| External Port | Internal Port | Protocol | Destination |
|---------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| 3000 | 3000 | TCP | Bambuddy server IP |
| 3002 | 3002 | TCP | Bambuddy server IP |
| 990 | 990 | TCP | Bambuddy server IP |
| 6000 | 6000 | TCP | Bambuddy server IP |
| 8883 | 8883 | TCP | Bambuddy server IP |
| 322 | 322 | TCP | Bambuddy server IP |
| 50000-50100 | 50000-50100 | TCP | Bambuddy server IP |

!!! tip "Recommended: Use a VPN"
    For best security, use a VPN like **Tailscale** or **WireGuard** between your slicer
    and Bambuddy. This encrypts all traffic including the FTP data channel
    (see security note above).

    Other options:

    - **Cloudflare Tunnel** — Free tunneling (TCP passthrough for ports 3000, 3002, 990, 8883, 50000-50100)
    - **nginx/Caddy/Traefik** — Reverse proxy for web UI only; FTP/MQTT/bind need direct access

!!! warning "Security Note"
    These ports will be exposed to the internet. The MQTT and FTP control channels are protected by TLS encryption and your printer's access code. The FTP data channel is not encrypted on the slicer side — use a VPN for full encryption.

#### Step 3: Enable Proxy Mode in Bambuddy

1. Go to **Settings → Virtual Printer**
2. Select **Proxy** mode from the mode options
3. Select your **Target Printer** from the dropdown
4. Click the toggle to **Enable Virtual Printer**
5. Verify the status shows "Running" with the proxy ports

#### Step 4: Configure Your Slicer

In Bambu Studio or OrcaSlicer:

1. Go to **Device** → **Add Printer** → **Add printer manually**
2. Enter your Bambuddy server's **IP or hostname**
3. Enter your **printer's access code** (not a Bambuddy password)
4. The printer should connect and show as online

#### Step 5: Print!

Select a model, slice it, and click **Print**. The job will be:

1. Sent to Bambuddy (encrypted via TLS)
2. Relayed to your printer on the local network
3. Started on your printer just like a local print

### Dual-Homed (Cross-Network) Setup

For setups where Bambuddy has interfaces on two networks (e.g., printer on LAN A, slicer on LAN B):

- Enable the virtual printer, then select the slicer-facing interface under **Network Interface Override**
- Bambuddy will re-broadcast printer SSDP on the slicer's network
- The slicer discovers the printer automatically via SSDP
- All protocols are proxied including camera streaming (RTSP port 322) — no additional NAT rules needed

### Proxy Mode vs Server Modes

| Feature | Immediate | Review | Print Queue | **Proxy** |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Files stored locally | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Sends to real printer | No | No | No | Yes |
| Remote printing | No | No | No | Yes |
| Requires target printer | No | No | No | Yes |
| Uses printer's access code | No | No | No | Yes |
| Requires Bambuddy access code | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

## Setup Check

Every virtual printer card has a **stethoscope button** (next to the delete button) that runs a built-in setup diagnostic. Reach for it whenever a virtual printer doesn't show up in the slicer or won't accept a print — it checks the things that usually go wrong so you don't have to guess.

The check probes, from Bambuddy's side:

| Check | What it confirms |
|-------|------------------|
| **Virtual printer enabled** | The VP is switched on |
| **Services running** | Its FTP / MQTT / discovery services actually started |
| **Bind network interface** | The bind IP still matches a live interface on the host — a stale bind IP after a DHCP lease change or a container restart is a common cause of "it vanished" |
| **Access code set** | Non-proxy modes have an access code configured |
| **Target printer** | Proxy mode has a target printer selected and reachable |
| **Service ports** | A live connection test of the FTP (990), MQTT (8883) and discovery (3002) ports on the bind IP. This is the decisive check — it confirms a service is genuinely listening, catching a port conflict that a "Running" status alone would hide |
| **TLS certificate** | The certificate chain exists on disk |

Each row is marked pass, fail, warning or skipped, with a short explanation of what to fix. After making a change, hit **Run again** to re-check.

## Troubleshooting

### Slicer Can't Find or Connect to Virtual Printer

!!! tip "Run the Setup Check first"
    Click the **stethoscope button** on the virtual printer card — the [Setup Check](#setup-check) pinpoints most of the problems below automatically (disabled VP, dead service port, stale bind IP, missing access code).

1. **Check virtual printer is enabled** and showing "Running" status in Bambuddy Settings
2. **Verify bind/detect ports are reachable** — the slicer needs port 3000 or 3002 for the handshake:
   ```bash
   # From the slicer machine
   nc -zv BAMBUDDY_IP 3000
   nc -zv BAMBUDDY_IP 3002
   ```
3. **Check firewall** — ports 3000/tcp, 3002/tcp, 2021/udp, 8883/tcp, 990/tcp, 2024-2026/tcp, 50000-50100/tcp must be open
5. **Same network?** — SSDP discovery only works on the same LAN/subnet. Use "bind with access code" for VPN, remote, or Docker bridge setups

### FTP Error / Connection Reset

1. **Check permissions** on the uploads directory
2. **Check no other FTP server** is using port 990
3. **Verify `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`** — the process needs this capability to bind to port 990
4. **Review logs** for specific error messages

### "Wrong Printer Model" Error

The slicer's selected printer profile must match the virtual printer model in Bambuddy settings.

### Permission Denied Errors

If you see "Permission denied" in the logs:

```bash
# Fix ownership of the virtual printer directory
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /path/to/bambuddy/data/virtual_printer
```

### Authentication Failed

1. Verify access code matches in both Bambuddy and slicer
2. Access code must be exactly 8 characters
3. Try removing and re-adding the printer in your slicer

### Wrong IP in SSDP / TLS Handshake Fails (Multi-NIC)

If Bambuddy has multiple network interfaces (LAN + VPN, Docker bridges, etc.), the auto-detected IP may be on the wrong interface:

1. Go to **Settings → Virtual Printer**
2. Enable the virtual printer if not already enabled
3. Under **Network Interface Override**, select the interface your slicer connects through
4. The virtual printer will restart with the correct IP in SSDP broadcasts and TLS certificate

### TLS Connection Failed / Error -1

This typically means the slicer doesn't trust the virtual printer's certificate.

!!! tip "Linux AppImage / Flatpak users — start here"
    The `printer.cer` shipped inside an AppImage or Flatpak is read-only, so editing it
    in place isn't possible without extracting the bundle. Recent Linux builds have
    `tls_cert_store_accepted: yes` set in `BambuStudio.conf`, which means the slicer
    trusts the system CA bundle. Install the Bambuddy CA there instead — see the
    [Linux tab in Step 2](#step-2-append-the-bambuddy-ca-certificate-to-slicer).

1. **Verify Bambuddy CA is in slicer's certificate file**:
   ```bash
   # Check that the Bambuddy CA appears in printer.cer
   grep -c "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" "/path/to/slicer/resources/cert/printer.cer"
   ```
   The count should be higher than a stock install (stock has 1 certificate).

2. **Wrong certificate?** If you have multiple Bambuddy hosts or reinstalled, you must update the certificate. See [Step 2](#step-2-append-the-bambuddy-ca-certificate-to-slicer).

3. **Verify certificate fingerprints match**. The **Slicer certificate** card in Settings → Virtual Printer shows the CA's SHA-256 fingerprint directly — the quickest reference. To read it from the server instead:
   ```bash
   # On Bambuddy server (Docker)
   docker exec bambuddy openssl x509 -in /app/data/virtual_printer/certs/bbl_ca.crt -noout -fingerprint -sha256

   # On Bambuddy server (native)
   openssl x509 -in virtual_printer/certs/bbl_ca.crt -noout -fingerprint -sha256
   ```
   Verify this fingerprint matches the one on the card, and that the CA appears in your slicer's `printer.cer`.

4. **Fully restart the slicer** — Cmd+Q on macOS, or End Task on Windows. Just closing the window is not enough.

5. **Regenerate certificates** (last resort):
   ```bash
   # Delete certs and restart Bambuddy
   rm -rf /path/to/virtual_printer/certs/
   # Then disable and re-enable virtual printer in UI
   ```
   You'll need to remove the old Bambuddy CA from the slicer and append the new one.

### Proxy Mode: Printer Shows Offline in Slicer

- Verify the target printer is online in Bambuddy
- Check that the printer is in LAN mode
- Restart the proxy by toggling it off and on

### Proxy Mode: "Connect Using IP and Access Code" Dialog When Printing

If the slicer connects and shows printer status but shows a connection dialog when you click Print:

1. **Check port 6000 is reachable** — BambuStudio uses this port for the file transfer tunnel:
   ```bash
   nc -zv BAMBUDDY_IP 6000
   ```
2. **Check firewall** — port 6000/tcp must be open between slicer and Bambuddy
3. **Different VLANs/subnets** — the MQTT IP rewrite ensures the slicer connects to the proxy, not the printer. Check Bambuddy logs for `IP rewrite active` to confirm it's working

### Proxy Mode: Camera Not Loading

- **X1/H2/P2 series**: Camera uses RTSP on port 322. Ensure this port is reachable from the slicer
- **A1/P1 series**: Camera uses port 6000 (shared with file transfer). Ensure port 6000 is reachable

### Proxy Mode: Connection Drops During Transfer

- Large files may timeout on slow connections
- Check your internet upload speed

## Technical Details

### Security

- **Bind protocol** (ports 3000, 3002): In proxy mode, Bambuddy responds with the VP's own identity (not forwarded to printer). Unencrypted TCP — transmits printer identity only, no sensitive data
- **MQTT control channel**: TLS-terminated at Bambuddy (TLS 1.2). In proxy mode, printer IP addresses in MQTT payloads are rewritten to prevent the slicer from bypassing the proxy
- **File transfer tunnel** (port 6000): End-to-end TLS (transparent proxy)
- **Camera streaming** (port 322): End-to-end TLS RTSP (transparent proxy)
- **Proprietary ports** (ports 2024-2026): End-to-end TLS (transparent proxy). Used by A1/P1S models for slicer–printer communication
- **FTP control channel**: End-to-end TLS (transparent proxy)
- **FTP data channel**: In proxy mode, transparent proxy — encryption depends on slicer/printer negotiation. Bambu Studio does not encrypt the data channel. Use a VPN for end-to-end data encryption
- Self-signed certificates are auto-generated (shared CA persists, per-instance device cert regenerates per serial)
- Access code authentication required for all connections (8 characters)
- Certificates stored in `virtual_printer/certs/` (shared CA) and `virtual_printer/certs/{id}/` (per-instance certs)

### Limitations

- Each virtual printer requires its own dedicated bind IP address
- SSDP discovery requires same LAN or routed subnets — use manual IP entry for tun-mode VPN, or Docker bridge setups
- Slicer must trust the self-signed certificate (see [Certificate Installation](#certificate-installation))
- FTP data channel unencrypted on slicer side (use VPN for full encryption)
- VPN tun mode does not support SSDP broadcast — printers must be added manually by IP

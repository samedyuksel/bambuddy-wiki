# Spool Inventory

Bambuddy includes a built-in spool inventory system to track your filament collection, assign spools to AMS slots, and automatically monitor filament consumption.

---

## :material-view-list: Inventory Overview

The Spool Inventory page shows all your spools in a searchable, filterable table with summary statistics.

![Spool Inventory Page](../assets/inventory-page.png){ .screenshot }

### Summary Cards

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Inventory** | Total filament weight across all spools |
| **Total Consumed** | Total filament used since tracking started |
| **By Material** | Breakdown by filament type (PLA, PETG, etc.) |
| **In Printer** | Number of spools currently loaded in AMS slots |
| **Low Stock** | Spools with less than 20% remaining |

### Filtering & Search

- **Status tabs**: Active, Archived, All
- **Quick filters**: Used, New
- **Stock filter**: All, Stock (no slicer profile), Configured (has slicer profile)
- **Dropdowns**: Filter by Material, Brand, Category, Spool Name, **Storage Location**
    - The **Storage Location** chip lists every distinct location currently assigned to your spools (e.g. *Shelf A*, *Drawer 1*), plus a **No location set** entry to find unfiled spools. The chip stays hidden until at least one spool has a storage location, so fresh installs aren't cluttered. Trailing whitespace is ignored, so `"Shelf A"` and `"Shelf A "` collapse to one option.
- **Search**: Find spools by name, brand, material, or color
- **View modes**: Table or Cards
- **Group similar**: Toggle to visually collapse identical unused/unassigned spools into a single expandable row or card with a count badge (e.g., "5 identical spools"). Spools are grouped by material, subtype, brand, color, and label weight. Used or AMS-assigned spools always appear individually. Group state persists across sessions.

---

## :material-plus-circle: Adding Spools

Click **+ Add Spool** to create a new inventory entry.

You can also **copy** an existing spool. Copying opens the Add Spool form with the existing spool data pre-filled, so you only need to change what is different.

When editing an existing spool, the modal header shows the spool's numeric ID (e.g. **Edit Spool #42**) so you can confirm which record you are modifying.

![Edit Spool — Filament Info](../assets/inventory-edit-spool.png){ .screenshot }

### Filament Info Tab

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Slicer Preset** | Search and select a filament profile (see [Where Presets Come From](#where-presets-come-from) below) |
| **Material** | PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, TPU, etc. (see [Custom Materials](#custom-materials) below) |
| **Brand** | Filament manufacturer |
| **Subtype** | Basic, Matte, Silk, HF, Metal, etc. |
| **Label Weight** | Net weight as printed on the spool (default: 1000g) |
| **Quantity** | Number of identical spools to create (1–100, default: 1) |
| **Color** | Visual color picker with recent colors, brand palettes, and hex input |
| **Extra colours** | Optional. Comma-separated list of 2 to 8 hex stops (e.g. `EC984C,#6CD4BC,A66EB9,D87694`). Leave blank for a solid colour. Without set *Effect* they will be rendered as gradient, or as colour wheel pie when **Subtype = Multicolor** is set |
| **Effect** | Optional. Visual rendering hint, see below.  |

#### Effects
Effects can be use to give a visual hint on the filaments look, covering: 

 - surface effects (*Sparkle*, *Wood*, *Marble*, *Glow*, *Matte*), 
 - sheen variants (*Silk*, *Galaxy*, *Rainbow*, *Metal*, *Translucent*)
 - structural variants (*Gradient*, *Dual Color*, *Tri Color*, *Multicolor*). 
    
They are rendered on top of the colour swatch, using the information from **Extra Colours** — effects do **not** change the slicer profile or anything the printer sees. 

Colour lists for multi-color filaments can easily be gathered from a site like 3dfilamentprofiles.com and pasted into the **Extra Colours** field.

![Effect overview for all subtypes](../assets/inventory-effect-overview.png){ .screenshot }

### Quick Add (Stock Spools)

Toggle **Quick Add (Stock)** at the top of the spool form to switch to a simplified mode. This hides the slicer preset and the PA Profile tab — only **Material** (required), **Brand**, **Subtype** (both optional), **Label Weight**, **Quantity**, and **Color** are shown.

Use Quick Add when you want to inventory filament without picking a specific slicer profile. These are called "stock" spools — they track weight and usage like any other spool, but they aren't linked to a printer filament profile. You can always edit a stock spool later to assign a slicer preset, at which point it becomes a "configured" spool.

!!! tip "Bulk Buying"
    Set the **Quantity** field to create multiple identical spools at once — for example, if you bought a 5-pack of PLA. All spools are created in a single operation with the same material, color, weight, and other settings. The quantity field is only available in Quick Add mode.

!!! tip "Group Similar Spools"
    After adding multiple identical spools, use the **Group** toggle in the inventory toolbar to collapse them into a single row with a count badge. This keeps your inventory clean when you have many spools of the same filament. Click a group to expand and see individual spools.

!!! tip "Multi-colour gradients and transparency"
    Multi-colour spools (gradient, dual-colour, tri-colour, multicolour) and translucent filaments now render correctly in the inventory. **Paste a hex list** like `EC984C,#6CD4BC,A66EB9,D87694` into the **Extra colours** field — that's the same format 3dfilamentprofiles.com puts on its filament details pages, so you can copy and paste directly. The swatch becomes a gradient strip; setting the spool's **Subtype** to *Multicolor* makes it render as a colour wheel pie instead. Transparency in the base colour (alpha < FF) shows through a checkerboard pattern beneath the colour layer, so partially translucent spools actually look translucent on the inventory page. Pick an **Effect** (*Sparkle*, *Wood*, *Marble*, *Glow*, *Matte*) for an overlay that mimics how the spool looks in real life. None of these affect the slicer profile or anything the printer sees — they're purely a visual hint to help you tell spools apart at a glance. The same fields exist on entries in **Settings → Color Catalog**, so a multi-colour combo can be saved once and reused across spools.

### Where Presets Come From

The **Slicer Preset** dropdown merges filament profiles from three sources, checked in order:

| Source | Badge | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Bambu Cloud** | — | Your personal cloud presets synced from BambuStudio. Includes both Bambu's official presets and any custom presets you've created (e.g., "# Overture Matte PLA @BBL P1S"). Requires [Cloud Profiles](cloud-profiles.md) login. |
| **Local Profiles** | `Local` (green) | OrcaSlicer presets you've imported via [Local Profiles](local-profiles.md). Useful if you don't use Bambu Cloud. |
| **Built-in Fallback** | `Built-in` (amber) | A static table of ~150 Bambu Lab filament IDs (PLA Basic, PETG HF, ABS, etc.). Always available, no login needed. |

Presets from all three sources are merged and deduplicated. If cloud login fails, local + built-in presets still appear — the preset list is never empty.

!!! tip "Selecting a preset auto-fills the Material, Brand, and Subtype fields from the preset name, saving you from filling them manually."

!!! info "Inventory vs AMS Slot Configuration"
    The spool inventory is for tracking **your filament collection** — every spool you own, regardless of whether it's loaded in a printer. You can inventory a spool of PETG sitting on a shelf even if no printer is currently using it.

    **AMS Slot Configuration** (see [below](#ams-slot-assignment)) is a separate action: it tells the printer what filament profile to use for a specific slot. The two features work together but serve different purposes.

### Custom Materials

The material dropdown includes common types: PLA, PETG, ABS, TPU, ASA, PC, PA, PVA, HIPS, PA-CF, PETG-CF, and PLA-CF.

**If your material isn't listed** (e.g., PCTG, PHA, PP, PVDF), simply type it into the Material field. A "Use custom material" option will appear at the bottom of the dropdown — click it to use your custom material type.

Custom materials work just like built-in ones for inventory tracking, usage history, and filtering.

!!! example "Example: Adding 3D-Fuel PCTG Pro"
    1. Click **+ Add Spool**
    2. In **Slicer Preset**, search for your closest PETG preset (PCTG is a PETG variant). If you have a custom OrcaSlicer profile for PCTG, import it via [Local Profiles](local-profiles.md) first and it will appear here.
    3. In **Material**, type `PCTG` and click "Use custom material: PCTG"
    4. In **Brand**, type `3D-Fuel`
    5. In **Subtype**, type `Pro`
    6. Set the color, label weight, and save

### Additional Section

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Empty Spool Weight** | Select from the spool catalog or enter manually (for accurate remaining calculations) |
| **Remaining Weight** | Current filament remaining — shows `label_weight - weight_used` with a reference maximum |
| **Cost per kg** | Used for archive cost roll-ups in Statistics. |
| **Category** | Free-text label like *Production*, *Prototype*, or *Client A*. Used purely for organisation — appears as an inventory filter chip and as a way to group spools that share a different low-stock threshold. The form autocompletes from categories already in use across your other spools so casing stays consistent. Optional. |
| **Low-stock threshold (this spool)** | Per-spool override of the global low-stock percentage. Leave blank to use whatever's set in the inventory's stat-card threshold control (default 20 %). Useful for marking *production* spools to alert earlier (e.g. 50 %) while letting *prototype* spools stay quiet until much later. The override applies to both the stat-card "Low Stock" count and the "Low Stock" filter. |
| **Note** | Free-text notes about the spool |

### PA Profile Tab

![Edit Spool — PA Profile](../assets/inventory-pa-profile.png){ .screenshot }

Link pressure advance (K-factor) calibration profiles to the spool:

- **Auto-select** matches profiles by brand, material, and subtype
- Shows matches grouped by printer and nozzle (left/right for dual-nozzle)
- K-factor values displayed for quick reference

---

## :material-link-variant: AMS Slot Assignment

Assign inventory spools to AMS slots to track which filament is loaded where.

### Assigning a Spool

1. Hover over any AMS slot on the printer card (empty or configured, non-Bambu-Lab)
2. Click **Assign Spool** in the hover card

![Assign Spool](../assets/inventory-assign.png){ .screenshot }

3. Select a spool from the filtered list
4. Click **Assign Spool** to confirm

The assign modal automatically:

- **Filters out Bambu Lab spools** — these are tracked via RFID and managed by the AMS
- **Filters out already-assigned spools** — each spool can only be in one slot at a time
- Shows only manually added (non-BL) spools

### Unassigning a Spool

1. Hover over an assigned AMS slot
2. Click **Unassign** in the hover card

The hover card shows the assigned spool's material, brand, color, and numeric ID so you can confirm the correct spool without opening the inventory page.

![Assigned Spool](../assets/inventory-assigned.png){ .screenshot }

### Bambu Lab Spools

Slots containing Bambu Lab spools (identified by RFID) do not show assign/unassign buttons. These spools are managed automatically by the AMS.

!!! info "Auto-Unlink"
    When a Bambu Lab spool is inserted into a slot that has a manual spool assignment, the assignment is automatically removed.

!!! info "Stable Assignments on Startup"
    Spool assignments are preserved across Bambuddy restarts. If the same spool is still in the slot (verified by RFID identifiers), the assignment is kept without sending any commands to the printer.

!!! info "Auto-tracking new Bambu spools"
    When a Bambu Lab spool is detected in the AMS and no inventory row already has its tray UUID, Bambuddy first looks for an existing **untagged** spool (matching material, color, and brand of "Bambu" / "Bambu Lab" / unspecified) and attaches the RFID to it — so a spool you logged ahead of time via Quick Add reuses your existing record (with your weight, notes, and cost data) rather than producing a duplicate. If no match is found, a new inventory row is created from the AMS data.

### Configure AMS Slot

AMS slot configuration tells the **printer** what filament profile to use for a specific slot. This is separate from inventory — it controls how the printer handles the filament during printing (temperature, flow rate, pressure advance, etc.).

1. Hover over an AMS slot on the printer card
2. Click the menu button (:material-dots-vertical:)
3. Select **Configure Slot**
4. Choose a filament preset
5. Optionally select a K profile and custom color
6. Click **Configure Slot** to apply

!!! info "When to Configure vs When to Assign"
    - **Assign Spool**: Links an inventory spool to a slot for tracking (weight, usage history, cost) **and automatically configures the slot** with the spool's filament profile, color, and K-profile. Works on both configured and empty slots.
    - **Configure Slot**: Manually sends a specific filament profile to the printer. Useful when you want to override the auto-configured settings or set up a slot without an inventory spool.

#### Where Configure Slot Presets Come From

The preset list in the Configure Slot modal comes from the same three sources as the spool form, but filtered by printer model:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bambu Cloud** | Cloud presets filtered by model suffix (e.g., `@BBL P1S`, `@BBL H2D`). Custom presets you created in BambuStudio appear here with a `Custom` badge. |
| **Local Profiles** | OrcaSlicer imports filtered by `compatible_printers`. |
| **Built-in Fallback** | Bambu Lab's filament catalog (~150 entries). Always available. |

Only presets compatible with the specific printer model are shown, reducing clutter and preventing mismatches.

!!! tip "User Presets"
    User presets that inherit from Bambu presets (e.g., "# Overture Matte PLA @BBL H2D") are fully supported. Bambuddy automatically derives the correct filament ID from the preset's base configuration.

---

## :material-qrcode-scan: Scan to Location (QR)

Instead of opening a spool's edit form and typing, you can **pick a destination first, then scan the spool's printed QR** to send it there in one step — handy when you're standing at the printer or shelf with a stack of spools.

### Assigning by QR

1. On the **Inventory** page, tap **Assign by QR**.
2. Choose where the spool should go:
    - **AMS slot** — select a printer, then the AMS unit and tray.
    - **Storage** — type (or pick) a storage location.
3. Scan the spool's label QR. The page uses your device camera live; if a small or dense code won't scan, tap **Take photo** to capture it with the native camera instead.
4. The spool is assigned to the chosen target and a confirmation appears — no edit form.

!!! info "One spool, one slot"
    Assigning a spool to a new AMS slot automatically clears its previous slot, so a spool is never shown in two slots at once. (A storage assignment just updates the spool's location field.)

!!! tip "Camera & HTTPS"
    The live in-page scanner needs a secure (HTTPS) connection to use the camera — set **Settings → External URL** to your HTTPS address (see [What ends up in the QR](#what-ends-up-in-the-qr)). The **Take photo** fallback works on any connection. Captured photos are read in your browser only — never uploaded or stored.

This reuses the same label QR described under [Printable Labels](#printable-labels) (`/inventory?spool=<id>`) — no special encoding is required.

---

## :material-scale-balance: Usage Tracking

Bambuddy tracks filament consumption automatically using 3MF slicer data as the primary source for all spools.

### 3MF Slicer Estimates (Primary)

For all spools — both Bambu Lab (RFID) and third-party — Bambuddy uses the per-filament `used_g` data from the archived 3MF file:

- Extracts per-filament usage from the slicer's slice_info
- Maps 3MF filament slots to physical AMS trays using the actual AMS mapping from the print command
- For **slicer-initiated prints** (BambuStudio, OrcaSlicer, Bambu Handy): captures the `ams_mapping` directly from the MQTT print command, ensuring the correct tray is tracked regardless of which application starts the print
- For **queue prints**: uses the stored AMS mapping for exact slot-to-tray resolution
- For **single-filament prints**: uses the printer's active tray for reliable tracking
- For **completed** prints: uses the full slicer estimate
- For **failed/aborted** prints: uses per-layer G-code data for accurate partial tracking, with linear progress scaling as fallback
- For **mid-print spool changes**: if a spool assignment is changed during a print, the live assignment is used for filament deduction (when the change timestamp is after print start); otherwise the snapshot from print start is preserved

### AMS Remain% Delta (Fallback)

When 3MF data is unavailable (e.g., G-code-only prints without an archived 3MF file), Bambuddy falls back to AMS remain% tracking:

- Captures remain% at print start and end to compute consumption deltas
- Only used for trays not already tracked via 3MF

!!! tip "Accuracy"
    3MF estimates come from the slicer and are very accurate for completed prints. For partial prints, per-layer G-code analysis provides precise filament consumption up to the exact layer where the print stopped. If layer data is unavailable, a linear estimate (total × progress%) is used as a final fallback.

### Usage History

Each consumption event is recorded with:

- Spool ID and printer
- Print name
- Weight consumed (grams)
- Percentage consumed
- Print status (completed / failed / aborted)
- Cost (calculated from spool cost/kg)

### Resetting Usage

Each spool's `weight_used` counter accumulates over the lifetime of the spool and feeds the **Total Consumed (Since tracking started)** summary card. Two affordances let you zero it out without touching anything else:

- **Per spool** — In the inventory table, an :material-eraser: eraser icon appears in the row's action column on active spools that have consumed grams. Clicking it opens a confirm dialog and resets that spool's `weight_used` to 0.
- **All spools at once** — On the **Total Consumed** summary card, an :material-eraser: eraser icon next to the label resets every active spool's counter in one go. The confirm dialog tells you how many spools will be affected.

Both actions leave the spool itself untouched: the label weight, remaining weight calculation, AMS lock flag (`weight_locked`), cost-per-kg, and storage location are not changed. Only the accumulated consumption counter goes back to 0. Future prints continue to increment normally — unlike manually editing the *Current Weight* field in the spool form, which auto-locks the spool and stops AMS auto-sync.

The bulk variant is the recommended way to clean-slate the **Total Consumed** stat (for example, after deleting all archives on a test instance) so subsequent prints track from zero. **Spoolman users get the same actions** — the request routes to Spoolman's PATCH `/spool/{id}` with `used_weight: 0` for each target instead of the built-in inventory table, but the UX is identical.

---

## :material-currency-usd: Cost Tracking

Track filament costs per spool and see cost breakdowns for every print.

### Setting Cost Per Kg

Each spool can have an individual **Cost per kg** value, set in the Additional section of the spool form. This value is used to calculate the cost of each print based on actual filament consumption.

### How Cost Calculation Works

When a print completes, Bambuddy calculates the cost for each spool used:

1. **Per-spool cost**: Uses the spool's `cost_per_kg` if set
2. **Default fallback**: Uses the global **Default Filament Cost** from Settings → Filament
3. **Formula**: `cost = (weight_used_grams / 1000) × cost_per_kg`

The calculated cost is stored in the usage history record and aggregated to the archive's total cost.

### Cost Display

- **Print modal**: Shows a real-time cost preview based on loaded filaments and their cost/kg values before starting a print
- **Archive cards**: Display the total filament cost for each print
- **Inventory table**: Includes a sortable "Cost/kg" column (hidden by default — enable via column settings)
- **Statistics**: Total cost across all prints is included in the stats summary

### Recalculating Costs

If you update spool prices or add cost data retroactively, use **Recalculate Costs** on the Archives page to update all archive costs based on current filament prices. This recalculates costs using:

1. Spool usage history records (by archive ID)
2. Legacy usage records (by print name, for older records)
3. Filament catalog prices (if no usage records exist)

### Default Filament Cost & Currency

Configure in **Settings → Filament**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default Filament Cost** | Fallback cost per kg when a spool doesn't have an individual cost set (default: 25.00) |
| **Currency** | Currency symbol used for cost display throughout the app (USD, EUR, GBP, MYR, and 23 more) |

!!! tip "Set Costs on Your Spools"
    For the most accurate cost tracking, set `cost_per_kg` on each spool when you add it to inventory. The default cost is a rough estimate — individual spool prices give you precise per-print cost data.

---

## :octicons-graph-16: Inventory Forecast

See inventory depletion rates based on material usage and handle stock logistics.

![Forecast main page](../assets/forecast_main.png){ .screenshot }

### Forecasting

The Forecast view shows all Inventory spools. Identical spool types are grouped together. 

Each rown can be expanded to show additional settings, data, and actions.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Effective lead time** | The maximum between the SKU Lead Time and the Global Lead Time |
| **SKU Lead Time Override** | A user defined lead time in days |
| **Safety Margin** | A buffer added on top of the statistical safety stock |
| **Reorder Point** | The point (expressed in grams) when the stock item should be reordered |
| **Add to Shopping List** | The cart icon adds the spool to the Shopping Cart. Quantity can either be expressed as spools or as days of stock |

The user can set a **Global Lead Time** that will override all lower lead times (or lead times that are not set).

The interface will alert of any stock breakage forecasted. These can also be sent via the notification service by enabling them in **Settings → Notifications**.
To exclude spools from forecasting and alert logging, click the Snooze icon in item row.

!!! tip "Set Lead Time on Your Spools"
    For the most accurate tracking, set Lead Time on each spool group.

### Usage

Material usage is calculated based on how many data points are available: 

**History-based (needs ≥2 print events):**

```
interval_rate = grams_used_in_print / days_between_prints   (floor: 0.5 days)
recency_weight = exp(−ln(2)/30 × days_since_print)          (30-day half-life)
```

**Weighted mean across all intervals:**

```
daily_rate = Σ(interval_rate × recency_weight) / Σ(recency_weight)
std_dev    = sqrt( Σ(weight × (interval_rate − daily_rate)²) / Σ(weight) )
```

**Delta-based (only 1 event, or no history):**

```
daily_rate = total_grams_used / days_since_spool_was_added
```

### Shopping Cart

The shopping cart lists all user added spools that are set to be reordered.

In the **List** view the user can set a row item as Purchased. Once set as Purchased, the item can set as Received to be removed form the list. 

!!! tip "Add Purcahses To Stock"
    All items marked as Received will be automatically added to Inventory in the Stock category.

![Shopping cart](../assets/forecast_cart.png){ .screenshot }

In the **Logistics** view a graph shows predicted stock variations based on reorder quantity and data.


## :material-printer: Printable Labels

Bambuddy can generate PDF labels for any selection of spools. The label carries the colour swatch (with multi-colour gradient stripes for spools that have extra colours), brand, material, name, the spool ID, and a QR code that deep-links straight back to that spool's row in Bambuddy when scanned with a phone — useful for finding the right spool in storage.

### Two ways to start

- **Per-spool icon** — every spool card and table row has a small printer icon. Click it to print just that one spool's label.
- **Header bulk button** — *Print labels…* in the inventory page header opens the picker pre-selected with every spool currently visible (i.e. matching your filters). Refine the selection in the modal.

### The picker

The modal lists the spools you can choose from with checkboxes. From the top:

- **Search** — substring match across name, brand, and `#ID` (e.g. type `#42` to jump to spool 42).
- **Material chips** — narrow the visible list to a single material (PLA, PETG, …). Chips are derived from your library so you only see what you actually have.
- **Select all visible / Deselect visible / Clear all** — additive selection actions. *Select all visible* adds the currently filtered list to your selection without dropping anything you'd already picked outside the filter; *Clear all* wipes the entire selection. This means you can build a selection across filters: filter to PLA, click *Select all visible*, switch to PETG, click *Select all visible* again — both groups are now selected.
- **Live "X selected" count** in the modal title so you always know what you're about to print.

### Template sizes

Pick the template that matches your label stock or holder:

| Template | Size | Per page | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AMS holder** | 30 × 15 mm | 1 | The popular [Makerworld AMS Filament Label Holder](https://makerworld.com/en/models/752566) (model 752566). Compact identification at-a-glance. |
| **Box label** | 62 × 29 mm | 1 | Brother PT/QL or Dymo small labels. Carries name, brand, material, storage location, and a QR code. |
| **Avery L7160** | 38.1 × 63.5 mm | 21 | EU sheet stock — A4 paper, 21 labels per sheet (3 columns × 7 rows). |
| **Avery 5160** | 25.4 × 66.7 mm | 30 | US sheet stock — Letter paper, 30 labels per sheet (3 columns × 10 rows). |

Sizes are exact — the renderer measures in points, not pixels, so Avery layouts align to <0.1 mm and don't drift across the page.

### What's on each label

- **Colour swatch** — the spool's `rgba`. Spools with multi-colour stops (`extra_colors`) render as vertical stripes in the order you saved them.
- **Brand · material · subtype** — small text row.
- **Spool name** — bold; what you set in the spool form.
- **Storage location** — italic, only on the box-label and Avery templates (the AMS holder is too small).
- **Spool ID** — large bold `#N`, anchored at the bottom-left. This is the killer field for telling 8 spools of "PLA White" apart in your closet, especially partials.
- **QR code** — links to `/inventory?spool=<id>` so a phone scan jumps straight to the spool's row in Bambuddy. The AMS-holder template skips the QR (no room at 30 × 15 mm) — the spool ID and swatch are enough at AMS-bay distance.

### What ends up in the QR

The QR encodes the URL Bambuddy can be reached at + `/inventory?spool=<id>`. By default this is the request's own scheme + host (`https://bambuddy.your-server.local/inventory?spool=42`) — if you set **Settings → External URL** to your public Bambuddy address, the QR uses that instead, so a phone outside your LAN can still resolve it. The same QR is what [Scan to Location](#scan-to-location-qr) reads.

### Print or save

The PDF opens in a new browser tab. From there you can either print directly to a label printer / sheet of blanks, or save the PDF and print later. Since rendering is server-side via [ReportLab](https://docs.reportlab.com/), the output is byte-identical across browsers — no "Chrome prints differently than Firefox" surprises.

### Limits

- Up to **500 spools per request**. Plenty for any realistic batch (a full Avery L7160 sheet is 21, a sheet of 5160 is 30; 500 covers ~24 sheets).
- The renderer truncates names with an ellipsis if a spool name is too long for the chosen template — for the AMS-holder size in particular, the *spool ID* is what matters; long names get truncated. If your spool name is consistently being truncated, consider a shorter `name` field on the spool itself.

---

## :material-cog: Settings

Configure the inventory system in **Settings > Filament**.

![Inventory Settings](../assets/inventory-settings.png){ .screenshot }

### Filament Tracking

Choose between:

- **Built-in Inventory** — Use Bambuddy's spool management
- **Spoolman** — Use external Spoolman integration

#### Sync Weights from AMS

When using built-in inventory, a **Sync Weights from AMS** button appears below the mode selector. This force-syncs all inventory spool weights from the live AMS remain% sensor values of connected printers.

Use this to recover from corrupted weight data — for example, if a printer power-off event caused all spool fill levels to drop to zero. The sync overwrites the stored `weight_used` values with the current AMS readings. Printers must be online for the sync to work.

!!! warning "Low Resolution"
    AMS remain% is integer-precision (1% steps = ~10g for a 1kg spool). For precise tracking, rely on the automatic 3MF-based usage tracker during normal printing. Use AMS sync only as a recovery tool.

### Spool Catalog

Pre-defined empty spool weights for quick selection when adding spools. Ships with 90+ entries covering common manufacturers.

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Export** | Download the catalog as a JSON file for backup or sharing |
| **Import** | Load a JSON file to add entries. Duplicates (same name) are skipped automatically |
| **Reset** | Restore the built-in default catalog (overwrites all entries) |
| **+ Add** | Manually add a new spool weight entry |

### Color Catalog

Pre-defined color palettes from filament brands. Ships with 600+ colors across 20 brands. Used in the color picker when adding, editing, or copying spools, **and as the single source of truth for resolving hex colors to human-readable names everywhere in the UI** — the Printer tab AMS popup, the inventory list, the print modal filament override cards, and auto-provisioned inventory entries all look up display names from this table. If a color name shows up wrong (e.g. "Scarlet Red" instead of "Cherry Pink"), edit the offending entry or use **Sync** to pull the canonical name from FilamentColors.xyz.

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Export** | Download the entire catalog as a JSON file |
| **Import** | Load a JSON file to add colors. Duplicates (same manufacturer + color name + material) are skipped |
| **Sync** | Fetch new colors from [FilamentColors.xyz](https://filamentcolors.xyz/) — a community database of measured filament colors. Only adds new entries, never modifies existing ones |
| **Reset** | Restore the built-in default catalog (overwrites all entries) |
| **+ Add** | Manually add a new color entry with manufacturer, color name, hex code, and material |

!!! info "Display names come from this catalog"
    Bambuddy resolves every spool color name by looking up the hex in this catalog (Bambu Lab entries are preferred when the same hex is registered under multiple brands). There is no hardcoded `tray_id_name` → name mapping in the backend or frontend — adding a color here is the supported way to correct or extend display names. Restart-free: the frontend refetches the catalog on next page load.

#### Import File Format

Both catalogs accept a JSON array. Spool catalog entries:

```json
[
  { "name": "Brand - Spool Type", "weight": 210 }
]
```

Color catalog entries:

```json
[
  { "manufacturer": "eSUN", "color_name": "Silk Gold", "hex_color": "#C48E2F", "material": "PLA Silk" }
]
```

!!! tip "Community Sharing"
    Use **Export** to share your catalog with others, and **Import** to load shared catalogs. This is useful for adding colors from brands not yet in the default database.

## :material-frequently-asked-questions: FAQ

### My material isn't in the dropdown (e.g., PCTG, PHA, PP)

Type the material name directly into the Material field. A green "Use custom material" option appears at the bottom of the dropdown. Custom materials work the same as built-in ones for all tracking features.

### Do I need to pick a filament profile for every spool?

No. Use **Quick Add (Stock)** mode to add spools with just a material type — no slicer preset, brand, or subtype required. Stock spools track weight, usage, and cost just like configured spools, but they aren't linked to a printer filament profile. You can filter stock spools on the inventory page, edit them later to assign a profile, or copy a similar spool and only adjust the fields that need to change.

In **full mode**, the Slicer Preset field is required. It links the spool to a filament profile ID that the printer understands. If you're just inventorying filament for tracking purposes, pick the closest available preset — for example, use a generic "PETG Basic" preset for a third-party PETG spool.

If you have custom slicer profiles (e.g., a PCTG profile in OrcaSlicer), import them via [Local Profiles](local-profiles.md) so they appear in the preset dropdown.

### I have different printers (P1S, H2D) and nozzles — do presets matter?

The spool inventory itself is **printer-agnostic**. You can add a spool once and assign it to any printer's AMS slot. Printer model filtering only applies when **configuring an AMS slot** (telling the printer which profile to use), not when adding spools to inventory.

When you configure an AMS slot, the preset list is automatically filtered by that printer's model — so you'll only see P1S-compatible presets when configuring a P1S slot, and H2D-compatible presets when configuring an H2D slot.

### Is inventory only for loaded filaments?

No. The inventory tracks **all your spools** — loaded and unloaded. You can add every spool you own to the inventory, even spools sitting on a shelf. The "In Printer" summary card shows how many are currently loaded in AMS slots, but unloaded spools are tracked just the same (weight remaining, usage history, cost, etc.).

### Where do the "Slicer Preset" profiles come from?

They come from three sources, checked in order:

1. **Your Bambu Cloud account** — if you've logged in via [Cloud Profiles](cloud-profiles.md), all your synced filament presets appear (including custom ones you've created in BambuStudio or OrcaSlicer and synced to cloud)
2. **Local OrcaSlicer imports** — if you've imported `.orca_filament`, `.bbscfg`, or `.bbsflmt` files via [Local Profiles](local-profiles.md)
3. **Built-in fallback table** — ~150 Bambu Lab filament IDs that are always available, no login needed

If you're not logged into Bambu Cloud, you'll still see local imports and the built-in table.

### What's the difference between "Assign Spool" and "Configure Slot"?

| Action | What it does | Affects printer? |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Assign Spool** | Links an inventory spool to an AMS slot for tracking (weight, usage, cost) and auto-configures the slot with the spool's filament profile, color, and K-profile | Yes |
| **Configure Slot** | Manually sends a specific filament profile to the printer (temperatures, flow, pressure advance) | Yes |

Assigning a spool is the simplest workflow — it handles both tracking and printer configuration in one step. Use "Configure Slot" when you want to manually override settings or set up a slot without an inventory spool.

## :material-lightbulb: Tips

!!! tip "Weigh Your Spools"
    For the most accurate remaining weight, weigh the full spool on a kitchen scale and subtract the empty spool weight. Enter this as the remaining weight when adding a new spool.

!!! tip "Low Stock Alerts"
    Keep an eye on the "Low Stock" summary card. Spools below 20% remaining are flagged so you can reorder before running out.

!!! tip "PA Profiles"
    Link K-factor profiles to your spools so the correct pressure advance settings are always associated with each filament.

!!! tip "Third-Party Filament Workflow"
    For non-Bambu filaments: **1)** Add the spool to inventory (pick the closest preset, type custom material/brand) → **2)** Load the spool in the AMS → **3)** Assign the spool to the slot on the printer card → **4)** Configure the slot with the correct filament profile. This gives you both accurate tracking and correct print settings.

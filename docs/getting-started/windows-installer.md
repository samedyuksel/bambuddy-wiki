---

# Windows Installer

The Windows installer sets up Bambuddy natively on Windows without Docker.

It checks the required tools, clones Bambuddy, creates a Python virtual environment,
installs dependencies, creates separate data and log directories, creates a start
script, adds optional firewall access, and can register Bambuddy as a Windows Service.

---

## :rocket: Quick Start

Run PowerShell as Administrator and start the installer:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maziggy/bambuddy/main/install/windows-installer.ps1 -OutFile windows-installer.ps1; .\windows-installer.ps1"
```

The installer will guide you through the setup.

It asks for:

- Installation directory
- Bambuddy port
- Whether Bambuddy should listen on the LAN or only on this computer
- Firewall rule creation
- Optional Windows Service registration

!!! tip "Recommended"
    Use the default installation path unless you have a specific reason to change it.

!!! tip "Unattended install"
    For managed deployments, add parameters after `.\windows-installer.ps1`
    in the same one-liner:

    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maziggy/bambuddy/main/install/windows-installer.ps1 -OutFile windows-installer.ps1; .\windows-installer.ps1 -Port 8010 -Yes"
    ```

---

## :material-tune: Installer Parameters

You can pass parameters directly after `.\windows-installer.ps1` in the download
one-liner or when running a previously downloaded copy.

| Parameter | Value | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `-InstallDir` | Path | `C:\Bambuddy` | Installation directory. The Git checkout is placed in `InstallDir\bambuddy`; data and logs are stored as sibling folders. |
| `-Port` | 1-65535 | `8000` | HTTP port used by Bambuddy. The installer checks whether the selected port is already in use. |
| `-Yes` | Switch | Off | Non-interactive mode. Accepts the default answer for yes/no prompts. |
| `-Silent` | Switch | Off | Non-interactive mode with reduced console output. |
| `-NoService` | Switch | Off | Skip Windows Service registration. |
| `-NoStart` | Switch | Off | Do not start Bambuddy at the end of installation. |
| `-LocalOnly` | Switch | Off | Bind Bambuddy to `127.0.0.1` instead of exposing it on all LAN interfaces. |

Examples:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maziggy/bambuddy/main/install/windows-installer.ps1 -OutFile windows-installer.ps1; .\windows-installer.ps1 -Port 8010 -Yes"
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maziggy/bambuddy/main/install/windows-installer.ps1 -OutFile windows-installer.ps1; .\windows-installer.ps1 -InstallDir C:\BambuddyLocal -Port 8011 -Yes -NoService -NoStart -LocalOnly"
```

---

## :material-folder-cog: Default Installation Path

By default, Bambuddy is installed to:

```text
C:\Bambuddy
```

The default installation path is `C:\Bambuddy` instead of
`C:\Program Files\Bambuddy` because Bambuddy is a Git-based Python application
that creates and updates a virtual environment, writes log files, and may be
updated through `git pull`.

Using `C:\Bambuddy` avoids common permission, UAC, path escaping, and
service-context issues on Windows.

!!! info "Custom path supported"
    During setup, the installer asks whether the default path should be used.
    You can provide a custom installation path if needed.

---

## :material-database: Data and Log Directories

The installer keeps user data outside the Git checkout so updates and re-clones do
not remove the database, archives, calibration data, or application logs.

Default layout:

```text
C:\Bambuddy\bambuddy   Git checkout
C:\Bambuddy\data       Database, archives, and application data
C:\Bambuddy\logs       Bambuddy application logs
```

The generated start script sets:

```powershell
$env:DATA_DIR = "C:\Bambuddy\data"
$env:LOG_DIR  = "C:\Bambuddy\logs"
```

When Bambuddy is registered as a Windows Service, the same values are passed to
NSSM through `AppEnvironmentExtra`.

!!! info "Existing installer users"
    If an earlier Windows installer run left runtime data inside
    `C:\Bambuddy\bambuddy`, the installer moves known data and log paths into the
    new sibling directories before starting Bambuddy.

---

## :material-shield-account: Administrator Rights

The installer checks whether it is running with administrator rights.

If it is not elevated, it relaunches itself through UAC.

Administrator rights are required for:

- Installing Git or Python with `winget`
- Creating firewall rules
- Adjusting folder permissions
- Registering Bambuddy as a Windows Service
- Replacing an existing Bambuddy service

---

## :material-source-branch: Git Detection

The installer checks whether Git is available.

If Git is missing, it installs Git automatically with `winget`:

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git --exact --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
```

After installation, the script refreshes the current PowerShell `PATH`.

---

## :material-language-python: Python Detection

The installer checks for Python 3.10 or newer using:

```powershell
python --version
py -3 --version
```

If Python 3.10+ is missing, it installs Python automatically with `winget`:

```powershell
winget install --id Python.Python.3.12 --exact --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
```

---

## :material-console-line: Installation Flow

The installer performs the following setup steps:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy.git
cd bambuddy
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
```

Fresh installs use a shallow clone for faster setup:

```powershell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy.git
```

The generated start script runs Bambuddy with Uvicorn. By default the installer
asks whether Bambuddy should be exposed on the LAN. If you choose LAN access, it
binds to `0.0.0.0`; otherwise it binds to `127.0.0.1`.

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

---

## :material-network: Port Selection

During setup, the installer asks which port Bambuddy should use.

Default port:

```text
8000
```

Example URLs:

```text
http://localhost:8000
http://<windows-host-ip>:8000
```

!!! tip "Choose a free port"
    The installer checks whether the selected TCP port is already listening. If
    another application already uses port `8000`, choose another port such as
    `8010` or `8080`.

---

## :material-lan: LAN Access

The installer asks whether Bambuddy should be reachable from other devices on the
local network.

| Choice | Bind address | Use when |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Yes | `0.0.0.0` | Other devices on your LAN should open Bambuddy |
| No | `127.0.0.1` | Only this Windows machine should open Bambuddy |

For unattended local-only installs, use:

```powershell
.\windows-installer.ps1 -Yes -LocalOnly
```

!!! warning "Bambuddy is unauthenticated by default"
    If you bind to `0.0.0.0`, anyone on your LAN (including guest devices and any
    active VPN tunnels) can reach the Bambuddy UI without credentials. Open
    **Settings → Security** and enable authentication before relying on LAN
    access. The installer's firewall rule covers only the **Domain** and
    **Private** profiles, so Public-Wi-Fi exposure is blocked at the OS level
    even when Bambuddy itself is bound to all interfaces.

---

## :material-shield-lock: Firewall Rule

The installer can optionally create an inbound Windows Firewall rule for the selected port.

Example rule:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Name | `Bambuddy TCP 8000` |
| Direction | Inbound |
| Protocol | TCP |
| Profile | Domain, Private |
| Action | Allow |

The rule intentionally excludes the **Public** profile so that Bambuddy is not
reachable on untrusted networks (cafe, hotel, airport Wi-Fi) where Windows tags
the connection as Public. If Bambuddy should only be accessed locally, the
firewall rule is optional.

---

## :material-script-text: Generated Start Script

The installer creates a reusable start script:

```text
C:\Bambuddy\Start-Bambuddy.ps1
```

Manual start:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Bambuddy\Start-Bambuddy.ps1"
```

The start script:

- Sets the Bambuddy working directory
- Sets `DATA_DIR` and `LOG_DIR`
- Uses the virtual environment Python executable
- Starts Uvicorn
- Uses the selected port and bind address

---

## :material-file-document: Logging

The installer creates installer and service wrapper logs in the installation
directory. Bambuddy's own application logs are written to `C:\Bambuddy\logs`.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `install.log` | Installer actions, dependency checks, setup progress, and errors |
| `bambuddy-runtime.log` | NSSM stdout from the service wrapper |
| `bambuddy-runtime-error.log` | NSSM stderr from the service wrapper |
| `logs\*.log` | Bambuddy application logs |

Default paths:

```text
C:\Bambuddy\install.log
C:\Bambuddy\bambuddy-runtime.log
C:\Bambuddy\bambuddy-runtime-error.log
C:\Bambuddy\logs\
```

!!! warning "Avoid double logging"
    When Bambuddy is registered as a Windows Service through NSSM, NSSM handles
    stdout and stderr logging. The generated `Start-Bambuddy.ps1` should not write
    directly to the same runtime log files.

---

## :material-cog-play: Windows Service

At the end of the installation, the installer asks whether Bambuddy should be
registered as a Windows Service.

If enabled, Bambuddy can:

- Start automatically after a Windows reboot
- Run without an open PowerShell window
- Be controlled with Windows service commands
- Restart automatically if the process exits unexpectedly

Service name:

```text
Bambuddy
```

---

## :material-package-variant: NSSM

The installer uses NSSM to run Bambuddy as a Windows Service.

NSSM is used because a normal PowerShell script or Python process does not behave
like a native Windows Service by itself.

The installer stores NSSM in:

```text
C:\Bambuddy\nssm\nssm.exe
```

The NSSM ZIP archive is verified with SHA256 before extraction.

!!! info "Why NSSM?"
    Windows services are expected to communicate with the Service Control Manager.
    Uvicorn and PowerShell do not do that directly. NSSM wraps and supervises the
    process.

---

## :material-play-circle: Managing the Service

Check status:

```powershell
Get-Service Bambuddy
```

Start:

```powershell
Start-Service Bambuddy
```

Stop:

```powershell
Stop-Service Bambuddy
```

Restart:

```powershell
Restart-Service Bambuddy
```

Show service configuration:

```powershell
sc.exe qc Bambuddy
```

Check startup mode:

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Service -Filter "Name='Bambuddy'" |
Select-Object Name, State, StartMode, PathName
```

Expected startup mode:

```text
StartMode : Auto
```

---

## :material-refresh-auto: Automatic Startup

When registered as a Windows Service, Bambuddy starts automatically after a system reboot.

The NSSM service is configured with:

```text
SERVICE_AUTO_START
```

The process restart behavior is configured as:

```text
AppExit Default Restart
AppExit 0 Exit
AppRestartDelay 5000
```

Exit code `0` is treated as a clean stop (the service stays stopped), and any
other exit — including segfaults, OOM kills, and unhandled signals — triggers a
restart after a 5-second delay. This matches the Linux installer's
`Restart=on-failure` semantics, so the production resilience is the same on
both platforms.

---

## :material-update: Updating

If the Bambuddy repository already exists, the installer can update it with:

```powershell
git pull
```

After updating, dependencies are installed again from `requirements.txt`.

Runtime data stays in `C:\Bambuddy\data` and logs stay in `C:\Bambuddy\logs`, so
the Git checkout can be updated or re-cloned without deleting user data.

!!! tip "Service users"
    If Bambuddy runs as a Windows Service, stop the service before updating and start
    it again afterwards.

```powershell
Stop-Service Bambuddy
.\windows-installer.ps1
Start-Service Bambuddy
```

---

## :material-console: Useful Commands

### Manual Start

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Bambuddy\Start-Bambuddy.ps1"
```

### View Service Status

```powershell

C:\Bambuddy\nssm\nssm.exe remove Bambuddy confirm
```

---

## :material-alert-circle: Troubleshooting

### Installer log is locked

If `install.log` is locked, close old PowerShell windows or previous installer sessions.

Then remove the old log if needed:

```powershell
Remove-Item "C:\Bambuddy\install.log" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

---

### Runtime log is locked

If `bambuddy-runtime.log` shows repeated file lock errors, make sure the start script
does not write directly to the same file that NSSM uses for stdout or stderr redirection.

Recommended setup:

- `Start-Bambuddy.ps1` writes only to stdout
- NSSM redirects stdout to `bambuddy-runtime.log`
- NSSM redirects stderr to `bambuddy-runtime-error.log`

---

### Service does not start

First test the start script manually:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Bambuddy\Start-Bambuddy.ps1"
```

If it works manually but not as a service, check the NSSM configuration:

```powershell
C:\Bambuddy\nssm\nssm.exe edit Bambuddy
```

Also check:

```text
C:\Bambuddy\bambuddy-runtime.log
C:\Bambuddy\bambuddy-runtime-error.log
```

---

### Delete and recreate the service

```powershell
Stop-Service Bambuddy -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
C:\Bambuddy\nssm\nssm.exe remove Bambuddy confirm
```

Then rerun the installer and register the service again.

---

### Git clone fails

Check whether the installation directory is writable:

```powershell
New-Item -Path "C:\Bambuddy\write-test.txt" -ItemType File -Force
Remove-Item "C:\Bambuddy\write-test.txt" -Force
```

If writing works but Git still fails, check antivirus or Windows Defender Controlled Folder Access:

```powershell
Get-MpPreference | Select-Object EnableControlledFolderAccess
```

---

### Port already in use

Choose another port:

```powershell
.\windows-installer.ps1 -Port 8010
```

Or find the existing listener:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000 -State Listen
```

---

### Non-English Windows permissions

The installer avoids localized `takeown` prompts and uses `icacls` with SID-based
permission grants instead.

---

## :material-security: Security Notes

- Run the installer only from a trusted source
- Review the PowerShell script before executing it
- Do not expose Bambuddy directly to the internet without protection
- Use a reverse proxy, VPN, or firewall rules for remote access
- Keep Git, Python, Bambuddy, and dependencies updated

---

## :material-arrow-right-circle: Next Steps

After installation:

1. Open Bambuddy in your browser
2. Add your first printer
3. Check the runtime logs if anything does not start correctly
4. Register the Windows Service if Bambuddy should run permanently

Continue with [First Printer Setup](first-printer.md).
